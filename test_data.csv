      Yes, I can recommend a green Amazon hotel. It's great. It isn't far to downtown and you take a tramway from to the hotel. You have a big swimming pool and center business, and you walk on Green street for chopping or go to a coffee chop. The rooms are nice and light with a big bed and very comfortable. You have too a wireless Internet in all rooms. it's OK ? The prices ? The prices are not expensive, $300 a night. Bye !

      The first people who give him opinion during the meeting was the CEO. He said the financial situation of the company is to bad. That's why the board of directors have decided to lay off employees. He wanted to find another solution, that's why he asked the executive to give them opinion about this issue. One of them proposed the merger with the concurrent company. In contrary, another one found we need to be more competitive, so to improve the marketing. Finally we didn't find any solution but the CEO said he will convince the board of directors to give us more time to find new investisors.

      I have been going out with my girlfriend for five years now. The way we met each other is pretty classical, she was a university student in the same class as me. We had to give a talk on Chinese linguistic. She wasnt my friend at all, but something happens, eyes-contact, she is so gorgeous! Then, it was pretty obvious we were interesting in each other. So, we began to go out with our respective friends and it was like we knew each other for a long time. For both of us, we knew we were the one very quiclky. Three months later we moved out together in China, and we still there, very in love, five years later. As they say, its a truly love at first sight.

      I'm little concerned about the future. My first concern is the ecology: more companies in developing world like in China or India use a lots of traitements moreover as we are more and more in the world we need more food so raise the production of food which means more and more pesticide. The second is for the job market, if in the future we will have robots, It will do everything instead life people! The workers will disappear so the rate of unemployment will increase indeed!

      Hi Bill, All the team was agree at the meeting today to use a TV soap star to represent our brand. People can identify better with this kind of person, as they see them frequently, they appear closer and more familiar. Furthermore, it's more believable that they eat a lot of peanut butter than with the sportmen : they don't have to follow a particular diet. We could use a sexy actress like Martina Paul, or Noemie Morton. What do you think about this idea? Best, Caroline

      Who doesn't want to be successful? What does success mean to you ? I think its best to start by defining success. Are you thinking about money or ability or friendship or education or teaching or family. If you have an idea for a business, if you are really passionate about it, if you still believe its the right thing to do, just do it! Business is simple, which isnt saying its easy. It could be an amazing success but also a failure. In a way, success and failure are inextricably linked. The biggest difficulty would be to you to know when you have to pivot or to adapt. On the other hand, opening your own business could be a life-enhancing experience to you. However, we are always speaking about business. There are many different types of success and many different ways which lead to success. What manner of success are you looking for exactly and with what kind of qualities ? Are you creative, innovative, incredibly passionate, persistent, are you able to bounce back from adversity. I think that the harder individual works, the most theyre successful and rewarded.

      My mother used to tell me that if both men and women could, each in his turn, get pregnant and if we supposed that women started, we wouldnt have more than three children by family. Take the time to think about it, isnt it true? In France gender equalities are registered in the law. Is it enough? The answerer is definitely NO. The main evidence is that many articles and TV report still devoted to this issue. They all point out that for the same job women still earn nearly 20 percent less than men. Even if the place of the women is no longer at home raising a family as her husband went out to work, she remains the one who puts her career enters bracket to rise children when she cant afford to pay a nanny. Then, it will be very difficult for her to find a new job or to come back to her previous position.

      France is a beautiful country , visited by millions of people each year and especially Paris. But if you are invited to a French person's home, do you know the correct etiquette? Here are some tips: Do bring a bottle of wine , box of chocolate or flowers. Do not leave the table even you are already finished. Help the host to clean the dishes and thank them for the meal. You can speak about politics but sometimes it could be dangerous because perhaps you don't defend the same side. Smoke , it's better to ask at the host if you can smoke inside.

      It is necessary to develop leadership qualities when you need to manage a team. It is not easy for everyone, because only few people has the potential to be a leader in their first job. The most of them has to work and develop the leadership qualities. I think the most important quality is people skills. The way you communicate with people working with you is very important. It is sometimes more important that what you say. In my opinion, the second point is to share a vision with your team. If you don't, your team won't be drive very long... An other point is your ability to accept criticism. Persuading each one in your team is great, but it's better if you do it after listening the differents opinions about projects and goals. At this list, I would like to add the ability to delegate. If you improve yourself to reach all this qualities, all your team will earn trust on you. And you won't have so many trouble sharing hardships.

      Donnie Darko directed by Richard Kelly is definitely a must-see movie ! Before his not very convincing 'The Box' based on the Richard Matheson's novel, he had conceived an unsung masterpiece. First screened incognito, it finally received a deserved acclaim once released on DVD. The great strength of the movie : mixing the genres swimmingly. We believe we are watching a thriller with a young schizophrenic inclined to murders whereas we are caught in a Gothic one. Stylized horror movie for few shots  besides, the action takes place on Halloween  while we attend to a genre movie, certainly, but a SF one. More than a mash-up, a combination of many elements or a borrowing to one genre or another, Kelly plays with frontiers. The movie becomes more than a meta-genre, it's a 'borderline' object. Beyond the psychoanalytic approach  although widely present  the word has to be taken at face value. The movie is in a perpetual balance, close to a rubbishy one because of the human sized rabbit's intervention, hero alter ego, related to his urges and came straight out of a B movie. Kelly draw his inspiration from this shared imagery and clichs which take the audience aback and make the surprise possible. Kelly transcends them. Indeed, he frees himself from frontiers to build something else. We are at the heart of the subject : the movie talks about human boundaries and getting over it, physically and mentally. Unsuspected capacities and self-denial. If you liked 'The Butterfly Effect', we would become familiar with his father : 'Donnie Darko'.

      In my opinion, television in France is quite around sex, couple, teens and reality shows. For example, reality shows or scripted reality inspired by American one, with young boys and young girls without any talents and any sense of intelligence in a big house. That's bullshit, shameful and degrading. First they fall in love for bad reasons, second they have sexual relationship face viewers, and at last, they realize their bad reasons to fall in love with the wrong person. I feel strongly that it is a very bad exemple for teenagers and even for young adults. They just have to know that we accept the love we think we disserve. Therefore, kids you have to think that you desserve better ! (good slogan isn't it)

      I just listened the song of Josh Woodward called 'Home Improvement'. It's a mix of folk and rock tune. The mood of the song is kind of drug, and it had kind of an annoying beat. It wasn't much of change, it has always the same mood, but It can turn out addictive. I listened to it six times and I can't get it out my head. However, you can dance it because of the song's melody was very quick. The lyrics are nostalgic and political.  It's a interesting song, and I recommend it, but how It makes me feel excited, I don't think it's a good idea to listen before to go to bed.

The server was very kind because he gave us a table with candles in front of the sea. It was very romantic. We drunk two glasses of champagne and after we had a big seafood tray with local products (shrimps, crabs, oysters, shellfish). We took the time to eat this and it was very pleasant to be only him and me. After this delicious main course, we had dessert: ice cream with chocolate. Sure the next year, we go back in this restaurant!

      Dear Corrine,  You know that I've been working as a manager of the art gallery in Paris for 2 years. Now I decided to quit my job because I hope to start my own business. It always been my dream. You know that if I were married it would be more difficult to realize it. But I am a single woman. I think if I were rich I wouldn't work at all. But I need money and I want to have more responsibility and a very rewarding and interesting job. It's a pleasure to tell you that I will sooner open my own art gallery in the center of Paris. It will be great, I am sure! Talk to you soon. Kind regards Ekaterina

      Does everybody agree with the different pay between men and women ? I guess not. Though, there is still a big difference between them, for equal work. But things are changing. Nowadays, the exemple comes from the politics, with the French government, which counts as many women as men. This is a good start. There is also huge differences than in the 1950s or before for some works, where women were absent and where today, they have a place, which doesn't stop increasing (like truck drivers). In France, and generally all over the world (or rather the Western part), everybody agree about equality for women, and for stopping machism. Men have the same roles for ages and want to keep them, and their privileges with them. That is why the most powerful places in the Administration and in huge international companies are still occupied by men, but, day after day, things are changing. The society is looking for new values. So, will things really change?

      The rules about behaviour in France are approximatively the same than other occidental countries. As we love eating, I'll concentrate my pointers about how to behave at a table dinner. DO Keep yourself straight on your chair. Put your hands on the table on each side of your plate. Put the napkin on yours laps. At the end of the dinner, don't re-fold it and put it on the table Raise your fork toward your mouth and not the opposite. Raise your elbow when you're drinking. Cut your bread with your fingers, not with your knive. DON'T Make big gestures with your fork and knive. Point out something with your knive Talk with some food in your mouth.

      In France we have about 30 free channels on TNT and many other with the satellite. In fact we have everything we want with Internet! Usually there is a lot of advertising and entertainment programs. But I seldom watch TV because I'm very busy.

      I propose some additional management strategies to prevent and solve business problems. Just a suggestion : we might use SWOT analysis, the management-strategy process where managers evaluate a project's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT). Then, we could develop a greater feeling of mutual trust between employees and managers. What I'm proposing is that we be willing to allow employees to take on greater responsibility; we should be willing to allow them to make more decisions. The more we can trust our employees to perform certain tasks without supervision, the more upper management can devote to expansion and profit strategies. Last but not least, I think communication is the key element of our success!

      Hi Ian, I've just read a leaflet concerning claustrophia and possible treatments. That furthermore convinces me that you should keep your job and try to cope with your current phobia rather than resign. I've understood that phobia is an irrational fear in enclosured areas that brings you the feeling of a dangerous situation. That triggers anxiety, panic and the physical symptoms connected : sweating, racing heart, shaking... I was very interested in the second part of the article dealing with solutions regarding to this problem. I suggest you look at them and experience the treatments proposed. I'm sure that ought to help you to manage your fears. You could try the behavioral therapy with the support of a Therapist who will learn you to develop a positive attitude and make you feel as safe as possible. You could also try meditation and relaxation to deal with the physical symptoms.%% What do you think about it? Are you ready to begin? See you soon

      Two weeks ago my friend Jean came from Paris to my village, for a day. We ate at a restaurant called &quot;The crayfish mill&quot;, which is located near a stream. Before I made reservations because sometimes they have a lot of customers and it's difficult to find the best seats with the good view. It was decorated with the tools and the pictures of the ancient mill. My friend was amazing, he was interested by the mill's story.  The weather was a bit fresh so we ate inside nevertheless we were able to see the stream and the pasture. We ordered for the main course trouts with mushrooms and asparagus. My friend is vegetarian but in that occasion, he choose to eat fish. The waiter told us the vegetable was organic and local. I didn't order dessert, my friend took an ice-cream. After we drank an expresso and we talk a lot. We had a good time

      The subject of this survey is about people's attitudes to voices and British english accents. Responding about the question if they're changing their voice depending on who they're talking to, a majority said yes. According to a little more than half of people asked, accents from the Midlands area of the UK are disliked. If they can, less than half people asked would change their voice, it's very strange ! Finally, we can see in this survey that only a few people asked, about 4%, have a very strong accent.

      In France there are a lot of rules about everything. The conduct policy are very specific. Speed limits are stupids, the rules were decided so many years ago. When the cars weren't safe. It's not allowed to drive with too alcohol in the bloodstream, this rule  is logical, there still are too many accidents on the roads of France related to alcohol. You can also lose your driver's license. Or maybe go to jail if the infraction is major. All rules aren't not adapted for our time, but I think most are important for our safe, otherwise the world would be much dangerous.

      Dear friend,in this country, you shouldn't yell down the street to a friend because it is inappropriate. You shouldn't stay too late when visiting. Canadians consider it impolite to invite you to leave. They expect you to choose the right time to go. Then, if you are staying in a big city, you should not go out alone at night because it could be dangerous and also, you mustn't smoke in any building, such as stores or restaurants, or any kind of public transportation.In this country, you should control your children. It is considered impolite to allow them to run and scream in public places without supervision. In stores and public offices, you should stand in line or take a number and then wait your turn to be served. It is condidered bad manners to push ahead of others for service.You are going to see, it's a beautiful country.See you soon,Laura

      Dear Sandra, I've had what I think is a good idea for a new addition to our product range. The details are below: Title: Endangered and extinct animals.  There a different levels of endangered animals so the pack could be sorted into these levels. Therefore, customers could play sorting games with them or games such as Happy Families. Environmental issues are very popular currently, so I think there would be a good market for this topic. Costs should be similar to Animals of the African Continent as we would be able to reuse many photos rather than paying for a picture of a dodo, the most famous of extinct animals, there are probably out of copyright pictures available.  If you would like to meet and discuss my suggestion, I would be happy to do so. Also, as I have had considerable experience on the American pack and also the Animals of the Americas project, I would be very keen on editing this new pack.  Best regards...

      I grew up in a city which is well-known for the band &quot;Les tambours du Bronx&quot;. It's an urban percussion band. The manner they play music is one of a kind. They creat music by hitting oil drums with a stick. They don't hit the oil drums at random. They creat a studied sound and music. On stage, concerts together 18 musicians. The costumes and the background are designed with a rock inspiration. The choreography is really impressive with the 14 oil drums position in arc. So, all these elements make the performance is really unique .It's not a coincidence that they perform their music all over the world and they are now a world-renowned band. But they don't forget their origin and they often play in the city where they began 25 years ago. When I can see them, it is always a pleasure because their performance style is unrivaled.

      When i was director in a Social and Cultural Centre, I owe to be the leadership. It was difficult because I had to persuade the team's members and the Charity Organisation's chairmen to share the same vision,  and working together. I wanted that all the members were on the same page. I learned to be patient and respectful of the members's ideas. I tried to create an environment where people work efficiently and effectively together toward the same goal. I followed some training which helped me to know better my weakness and my strengths. I understood that i asked exaggerated commitments of all the people.  My empathic and my charism helped me a lot to carry out some projects successfully. But I must recognise my failures, honestly is crucial in these circumstances. I had to find out why it didn't work? Why it was beyond our control? Why I didn't have the mental agility to propose another strategy, to change in front of difficulties? To be a successful leadership needs to be able to put himself in other's people shoes but also to be able to expect the unexpected.

      Dear Sir and Madam,I am writing to enquire about the possibility of requesting a loan. I would like to buy the house I am currently living in.I believe that it will be cheaper for me to buy than to rent in the long run. Not only will I benefit from the property equity, but also would I benefit from a sense of stability. Please find enclosed a budget outline including my income, expenses and savings per month. As you will be able to see, my finances should allow me to buy the house. Each month, I pay a $500 rent to my landlord and save $300 on a high interest savings account. This amounts to a total of $800 that I will have to pay off the loan.Should you need more information, please do not hesitate to contact me at xxx@free.com or call at ### ### ###.I look forward to  hearing from you soon.Yours sincerely,Zoe Freeman

      I'm pessimistic, the future will be technolgic, and it will improve the life for a lot humans. But the future will be also very bad for the environnement, so i think, it will be difficult for the next generation to keep the same level life. I 'm afraid we will be obliged to renounce to use some usual equipments. But may be technology can resolve this problem. A agreement with differents countries seems to me indispensable to solve the environnement issue.

      French television has many programs and it is very difficult to classify. Cable channels broadcasting over soap operas, game shows and entertainment than traditional channels, and these programs are often worse. I like Canal Plus, because there is a lot of sport and football in particular. Now the TV is very important in people's live. It's not violent, pornographic, but it's not more education. The TV is only there to entertain the audience in the selfish society. I want a French television to do reflect, educate and open the eyes of the world.

      I'm quite pessimistic about the future. My first proccupation is about the environment and its pollution which has been getting more and more serious through decades. Global warming has been becoming very dangerous. In the future, seasons might disappear : for instance, when in winter temperatures must be low, at this time of the year in Paris, the weather is like the one we could expected in Spring while in Jerusalem, it's snowing and in New-York, American citizens are freezing! This is really disturbing, not just for us but most of all for animals and insects. Some ducks have began their migration because of the weather while it shouldn't begin before a long time.

All his colleagues say Sege is easy-going. He is often first in the office and work late. I'm sure that with him we'll never fall behind our deadlines. Everyday he can cope with a lot of problems. I don't regret promoting him last year. He has to improve some points. He isn't what I call a team-worker and he likes working on his own. For these reasons, he can't manage a team over 2 or 3 people. No problem as long as these people are specialists. One point to have in mind&nbsp;: He isn't in good health and we need to be careful at overtime. I think he has to get a pay rise.%%

      In  France, there are still big differences between males and women. The main example is the salary difference : male salary often  reach a 25 percent more than woman's ! Why men are so advantaged when it comes to salaries ? Well, I guess it has to deal with History, because women have always been considered as housewifes, raising the kids and keeping the house clean. However, I think that nowadays, things should have changed : shouldn't men and women have an equal salary for an equal job ? However, roles haved changed : now, some men don't work to raise the kids and stay at home, whereas their wifes work.

      On this line graph from 2004 to 2008, the first think to keep in mind is that if the National sales figures were lower up to mild 2006, we are very glad to notice that, since the end of this year 2006, our increase of books sales has been bigger than it does in the rest of the world. We can see, with pleasure, that our country, always, loves reading if, however we can show in bookshops and libraries, valuable books either novels, essays biographies, or technical publications. Since 2006 we were fortunate, to have many successful tittles, I don't want to name them, but anybody could guess. These many successes with highest sales have allowed national book industry to recover his natural level. But it's often difficult having many exceptional best-sellers, so, since the middle of 2007 we can notice a sharp decrease, what, however, sounds to be slowing down with the arrival to the national reading people of these two novels that met and meets still a phenomenal succes. We are confident for the future. Good reading to anybody. This was the speech from Mrs Booking President of National Readers Association, on 22nd of May 2008.

      I'm not optimistic about the future. In my opinion, I think that by this way of using the renewable energy we cannot fight against global warming. This method is used in a very limited way and it cannot respond to the challenge. Also if we look around us, we can believe that pollution will increase more and more. In fact, technical progress and population growth will cause negative effects on the earth. For me, I cannot guess about the future if we stay on this condition. I hope so that I will be wrong but we must be realistic.

      For the moment I'm pessimistic about one part of the future that concern the energy use for the cars. Until we find a new technology which can create a lot of energy with clean resource that create no pollution and doesn't destroy the ozone layer. The engineer will use all the possibility even those that are no good for the environment to create energy. I know that the electric cars are in development to avoid to make pollution but the lithium use to create the battery is not very abundant. I think that the good way to follow is the development of H2O combustible. However, for all the other technology which permit create clean energy i'm very optimistic.

      In France, the trend is to have long studies. A recent survey suggests that you have fifty percent more chances to get a job if you get an MBA than a bachelor's. But i'm not totallly agree with this survey. In my opinion, you could find a good job if you have a technical degree, for example to become a cook. You should have a bachelor's, but it's not too expensive to get it and you have good chances to get a job. And more and more studients with MBA don't find a job...

      Dog Goat is really fun. It''s a kind of word game. The first player has to say 'dog.' Then the second player says 'goat' because 'dog' ends with 'g' and 'goat' starts with 'g.' Then, the next player has to add a word that starts with 't' because 'goat' ends with 't.' For example, he can say 'Tuesday.' If he says 'Tuesday,' the next player has to say a word that starts with 'y,' like 'yellow.' Sometimes, players are only allowed to use food words. For example, players can say: 'cake-egg-goat-tea-apple.' You're not allowed to use a word twice. When the players can't think of a new word, the game is finished.

      Dear Mr. Martin,I want to apply for the job as a fitness instructor at your sports centre because I know how to motivate and encourage people who wants to get into shape and loose weight. Indeed, I worked until 2002 at the PKO Body Centre who I could acquire several skills in the field. I am currently working as a P.E. teacher at an High School. This occupation brings me a lot of professional satisfactions. I enjoy working with young people and help them to develop their abilities, to find a rewarding sense of their own identity and to choose an healthy lifestyle. Nevertheless, I have been working at the same High School for twelve years and, today, I want to find another job in order to bring some changes in my life, although I always have great satisfaction with my job. The job you offer would be for me the ideal occasion to step into my new life. Yours sincerely,Julien Sellier

      Dear Sir, I am writing regarding the overtime I am due . I had to work extra hours during two weekends and I object that you refuse to pay this overtime. My contract clearly states that I should be compensated for my weekend work. Furthermore, you argue that these extra hours weren't your fault, this argument can't be considered as nothing in my contract allows you to refuse to pay me for something the company is not responsible of.  Consequently I believe I am within my rights to claim being paid for the two weekends I had to work. Should you refuse to pay, I would consider the possibility of suing the company for damages. I hope there is an opportunity to settle out of court. Yours sincerely MAP

      Hi peter I would like to summarize you the last negotiation about our purchase with SND Company. To clarify, over the next two years we will need 50 computers including 20 laptops. Their preliminary offer was $1,100 for the desktops computers and $800 per laptops. It was way too high for us, you know that we have a though budget limitations. So, thats true that we were excepting a better offer from them. However, after trying to be more flexible on the both sides, we finally came to an agreement. We decided to buy 15 more laptops and they agreed to offer us a bulk discount. To finalize this, we just have to talk about the service plan. Ill send you the invoice with all the details.

      Title : The Imperial Cities All the countries on the world have their symbols .It is important because these symbols in the most cases represent the real identity of the country . For my country ,I think that the Imperial Cities are the best symbol that we can talk about without stopping . The main reason for that is the representation of these cities about the ancient history of our country featured by a succession of monarchical dynasties which had had an impact in each period of our civilisation . This kind of impact was very diversified and substantial . The architecture of these cities is one of these influences . All those were protected by a very strong walls against external agressions and within the cities the habitations were very traditional and typical of every area .Many of them were so original that they were classified in the World Heritage of the UNESCO .

      Hi Tim, I lived a scary experience three years ago. I was invited at Anthony's home, who is my best friend. This night, we were five persons. Julie proposed to make a strange experience. She had done it with his father a long time ago, and she wanted us to share it. The goal was to speak with spirits. We found that it's a strange idea, and even impossible. How can we speak with dead person ? We laid on the table scraps of paper with each letter of the alphabet. We have also taken a glass. Each person put a finger on the glass, closed his eyes, and Julie asked a question for the spirit. After a few minutes, the glass began to move and headed toward some scraps of paper. The answer was consistent. That was incredible. Interesting, right ? We'll try this if you want. Jack

      The enclosed graph is comparing international and national sales figures for best book company from 2004 to 2008.The first thing you can easily notice is that while international sales were high, national's were low and vice versa.In 2004 while national sales raised slightly to $1m and stood stable till 2006, in the same period, international sales suddenly increase to hit their peak of more than $2m in  middle of 2005. But before 2006 begins, the sales fell dramatically to $1m over a month. And finally slow down and fall slightly to $800t at the end of 2006. The first months of 2007 the sales decreased suddenly again to hit $500t, and then were steady till 2008.While international sales increased suddenly, national's stood steady to $1m till 2006. And increased gradually to hit their peak of more than $2m in the middle of 2007, but started to fell dramatically to almost $1m only a month after their peak. Then till 2008 it kept falling gradually to finally hit $1m.

      The Hang Seng Index (HSI) often referred to as the most important stock market index in Hong Kong, has seen a dramatic reversal of fortunes this year.  Over the six first months, the index was quiet volatile, as it climbed to a high of 27,499 to finally drop to a low of 20,956.  Next, over the past six months, the index has experienced steady growth, essentially due to massive investment from Mainland China. This positive evolution is mainly due to the spectacular rise of Properties and Utilities Sub-Indices. Now the index is close to 30,000.  Experts believe that this index will only go up next year, thanks to massive investment from other countries, as well as Hong Kongs internal demand.

      For me, what people calls office politics is really not office politics. I call it management. Let me explain: if you want to be a great chief executive officer, you just dont have to deal with your skills and abilities. Indeed you have to deal also with people, competition and environment and they are not an easy stuff. When you are an employee, it is almost the same thing: you have to deal with competition, environment and people. Since you have understood these facts, you can take office politics like a train before being a very great chief executive officer. To succeed to this training, you need more than your skills. In fact you have to be careful with your colleague, they can become your competitor or your backstabber. You have to seek the advice of your boss and learn from him every time. Dont forget humility, its your best weapon. Indeed you will learn from everyone in your organization even the least important employee.

      Dear Ms Mikyoung, I am writing to you because I would like to do an internship in your office, which would be an exciting opportunity to add to my experiences in landscape architecture. I am a recent graduate of the National School of Landscape Architecture at Versailles with very high honors. My education, both through my recent degree and an additional diploma certificate (BTS) in Landscape Design , have allowed me to acquire a very thorough technical and sensitive knowledge linked at the question of living which makes up the strength behind my work. The last six years were enriched by internships in which I have been a part at several projects and ongoing studies. These professional experiences have allowed me to see a variety of problems linked to the question of landscape on all scales. I had the opportunity to work on a project from beginning to end throughout it is development, starting from a diagnosis and ending at the construction site. It has made me aware of the realities of a project and also of his time scale. I am very interested in working in dynamic company like yours with so many different projects. I feel that an internship at MIKYOUNG KIM would be a great learning experience for me.%% The scale and diversity of projects that you defend is ambitious and challenging for me. I am also very attracted by the international dimension of your office. That is why I would like to participate in the development of your projects within your agency of Boston. I would be happy to use my French experience while working with your company. Indeed, I think that the artistic approach in developing projects that I acquired while at the school of Versailles could certainly be enriching. I am someone who is energetic, enthusiastic and who possesses excellent team spirit. Most of all I am passionate about my work. In regards to my legal eligibility to work with your company, I would be participating in the J-1 Visa Internship USA program. I will pass by a French organization to obtain the J-1 Visa. In order to have time to do the administrative steps, I am interested in an internship beginning in March for a period of four to six months. I look forward to speaking with you soon about this exciting opportunity. Please feel free to contact me for further information or to discuss other issues. Yours sincerely, Marion Baret

      I can recommend you the &quot;Grand Turc&quot; Hotel. It's right downtown. It's close to the backery and the dispensary. The rooms are clean. There is a nice swimming pool. I think that rates are reasonable. It's quiet. But I don't know if there is free wireless internet in room's hotel.

      The cottage offered the seascape asked by the Brights family. Recently renovatedthere is no need of renovation but there is just one bedroom and that is really the bad point for this family.The New apartments could represent a good investment. This family need to buy a &quot;family propriety&quot; in order to rent it out outside the period of holidays. A flat don't represent their idea of the Ionian sea with this particular atmosphere.The luxurious Villa and business Is a too biggest property with too much apartments in. This property oozes with the sounds of the city, even if it's located in a quiet and traditional place, you can't find the calm and serenity given by the picturesque colors of the Ionian sea. With the Hamilton house, the Bright family's  will found  a property at the size of their family, it represent a labour of love and the wave of a magic hand is not necessary, this propriety is a little jewel.

      About six months ago, I sold some electronic goods online to earn some money for summer vacation. There is a website where we can put an ad online. I used to sell and buy things thanks to this website. My preliminary offer was 80 euros for an electronic dictionary, 20 euros for a coffee maker, 25 euros for a headset, and 130 euros for a laptop computer. Someone asked me for a discount. He said that he would buy all at once so that he could get a 20% discount. But I said that a 20% discount was out of the question even if he bought all at once. I proposed a 10% discount as my counteroffer and a 4GB USB drive as a freebie. He accepted my offer and we made a great deal.

Suddenly the box seemed to move, little moves. At this time Patrick knows that something with this box was absolutely weird , and Bleck had felt it.

      I study to be an architect and I graduated from Paris 's university . I worked five years in the same compagny . The labor was intensive but I was passionate and hard working. I like very much my job. Unfortunetely I fired and I was living out on the street and strapped out. I deppressed but I decide to struggle me for job ! So I was real Lucky and I got a job into real estate market. It was boring but I got some money and I could rent my own flat. But it was a fallback career until the economy fall drastically with the bublle burst and I lost clients over cjlients. I quited this job because I didn't earn my life enough. Currently I take a training in new green trade. If economy turns around I hope for the futur that the market picks up and I can go back into architecture or something like that because I 'm fancy of it.

      i just heard a song by Josh Woodwart called 'Home Improvement' , a folk-rock tune, what a beautiful song! First, Josh sings quiet, low notes .Then the melody changes, and he sings the high notes a little louder. He has a great range and lightly hits the high notes. You can't really dance to this song because there is addictive beat and Josh's voice is rough and edgy. But the song has kind of a sentimental melody and a part of sadness who made me think about my romantic relationship.  Anyway, i recommend you this music you should listen to it.

Next, I will get more work experiences in varied teaching contexts (teaching with projects, serious game, online collaborating tools, massive use of documents in english langage - text, audio, video) 3. Another thing I will do is to improve my teaching skills in scientific computer fields. 4. The fourth stage of my plan is to collaborate with an international teaching project (good oppportunity to meet potential partners) 5. Finally, I will make great publications in english and produce contents for e-learning platforms.

      In 2010, I got my Master's degree from the university of sciences and technologies Bordeaux I in logistics and production management. after that, I added one year in an engineering school at Toulouse in project's management. Following my final internship at the SNCF company, I was hired in the same one as a maintenance engineer (Railway technology). Because of the economic crisis, I wasn't able directly after my graduation to find a job in my discipline, this is why I accepted this job, but it still nevertheless very interesting and well paid. Now, the economic situation in France become slightly more propitiuous for me to get another job in production management, and that's why I am doing actually in parallel an e-learning courses in SAP certification. This latter, will help me to get more chances to get the job that I dream about it : Production engineer! frankly, I hope to get an experience of one to two years in France as a prduction engineer before getting back to Morocco and continue my career path as production director in another factory. It's from there that I can marry my beloved one which is now in Morocco and done a PhD in Geophysics.%%

In parallel, I need to improve my knowledge in biostatistics and my english, because in the job of researcher, good english speaking and writing skills are necessary. 3. Next, I've planned to work in foreign country for one or two years, in order to improve my work experience and my CV. It could also give me the opportunity to establish some international professional networks. 4. Finally, I will come back in France to work in the laboratory I would have chosen.

Subsequently, I worked for three years as accountant in a company who sold plumbing and electricity materials. I was made redundant for economical reasons. Afterwards, I found a job as Financial Manager in a trucks transports company. I stayed into this position for seven years. I quited this company in 2010, I found another job in a company who sells trucks and cars tyres. For the second time, I was fired, an economical redundancy. At this time, I'm unemployed, since October the first. I had several job interviews, but none of this companies hired me. For the future, if I don't find a good position, maybe I will start my own business or I will look for a job abroad, for example in the north of America.

      To become a successful leader, you have to work hard to get as much knowledges as possible : you have not to be an expert in all fields, it's naturally impossible, but you must own a minimum of knowledges to have a large vision of your departments. In a very fierce and worldwide competition, you must arbitrate and do choices, and it's not always easy. If you pay too little wages, the staff is no longer motivated and you aren't attractive for the more skilled applicants, but on the contrary, rewarding too much prevents you from staying competitive. You must keep doing agreements. That's why you have to own or to get very strong personnal qualities : you must always adopt the appropriate behaviour : be stern or sympathetic according to the situation. A leader depends on his staff to succeed : he must have a strong team spirit, and own strong skills of analysis and synthesis.

      In France, the disparities between the women and the men are reducing, but we are still far from the equality. To illustrate this topic, which indicator to take? The main indicators are: the education, the health, the unemployement, the salaries, the employment, the poverty, the living conditions and the public life. On the last point, there are more women in the political sphere. The law of June, 2000 contributed to a better feminine representation in the national and local executives. But only 26.9% of women sit in the National Assembly. At the local level, only 2 women are at the head of 22 Regions. 13.8% of the mayors are women and these represent only 6 of 38 municipalities of more than 100 000 inhabitants. That's better than before, but we must keep it and improve.

      Never said: &quot; I shop therefore I am&quot;! Firstly. When you go outside, never take any money. Why don't you replace the busy shopping streets with the country? Secondly. When you go shopping, you should make shopping lists. Always ask the price before buying something. You don't buy on credit! Don't believe that on-line offerings are cheaper, prices can be lower.

Actually, rules and law regarding health and securtiy are made both to protect citizen and ensure its security. Furthermore, in each location, it's mandatroy to display the specific procedure of security and the laws to apply in case of non-compliance. But, what about the change management.

      In France, mostly all the people are looking on a good etiquette. You are expected to be polite, to say &quot;good morning&quot; or &quot;hello&quot; and also to say &quot;please&quot; and &quot;thank you&quot;. When you are invited, I will give you some important pointers.. First make sure do not be too late! It's fine to kiss someone on the cheek (typical for French people). Also it's polite to take a small gift. Compliment your host on the cooking. Don't ask personal questions and do not leave to late. But first of all, you are expected to enjoy the time. Try to be cool and have a good time.

      To create a successf ul project and solid teamwork, I proprose that companies use the swot analysis technique. Swot helps a business evaluate internal and external strengts, weaknesses, oppportunities and treats. Let's say you carru out a swot analysis at the beginning of the project. The first thing is to make sure that project goals are clear. Then, I'd say you should make a list of questions to satisfy each element of the swot analysis. You want to make sure all the major project tasks are covered and identify passible risks. My thought then would be to take swot even further team members could collaborate on a swot analysis of the team itself, making them a stronger team and developing mutual trust. For example, if the team spends time identifying theit strengths, then the resulting information can actually motivate the team. And, as they identify weakneseses, they become more aware of how to prevent future problems. Once you complete a swot analysis, I suggest that you review it frenquently. Change the questions and answers as the market changes, and focus on taking advantage of your strenghts and oppportunities and reducing your weaknesses and threats.

      Mister, I just ate in your restaurant, and I am very disappointed. Firstly, for starter, I have had a salad with tomatoes which isn't fresh , after that the waiter,not very helpful and friendly, brought the main course, fish and potatoes which is very too oily and salty, the red wine was bitter, only water was good. For dessert, I took a vanilla and chocolate ice cream, and it wasn't better, it had a taste sour and disgusting. I won't come back and I won't advise it to my friends.

      I have been living in the South West of France since 2000 and I have discovered that each region has its custom which makes it special. So, I'd like to speak about a traditional dance called' La Danse sur Echasses' of that agricultural region where I am living. In ancient times, because it  was a marshy area, when shepherds were guardering their flocks of sheep, they had to use stilts for walking. Thanks to that elevating position of moving, they could take advantage of it. First, even in wetlands, they could easily look after their flocks. Then, they could see over the hills and so far away in the country that they never got lost. Unfortunately,little by littlle,shepherds,herds,woods began to disappear with the development of industrialization. Despite of that, the traditional stilts weren't all-forgotten and  became an important accessory of dancing! Nowadays, if you like traditional folk entertainment, you can attend an open-air show. What an engaging performance! I love watching these kind of dancers who are wearing bright colored costumes . How fascinating they are when they began to dance round in circles with those strange shoes!

      I'm going to talk about a presentation which was maked by one of my teachers of vegetal biology. One thing that she did well was present the plan of the presentation. Her opening was clear. However, I would have liked her to be more interesting about what she was speaking. Indeed, her voice was monotonic and we could imagine how she's doesn't care about what she was saying. Moreover, she didn't use any illustrations, figure, any support for we more understood. This is not a good speaker. She was so serious, we were expecting bad news. One thing she could do differently was talk a bit louder because we didn't hear anything.

Teleconferencing and digital technologies will improve lives on earth and decreasing the number of displacements: better medical diagnosis by world experts without travel,  more meetings between people living in different countries, more exchanges between human body. The major consequences for humanity was probably : development of democracy, fewer conflicts and wars, increase in life span, decrease of pollution.

      CSR is a very controversial issue which relates to many political, economic and ethical discussions. On the one hand, some people believe that CSR is a way to make the private companies look good and helpful. At best, it would be a PR trick, a publicity stunt or a marketing device. At worse, it would be a way of demotivating workers to fight for their rights and to engage in social struggle. It's the point of view of left wing politicians. On the other hand, most people are convinced that companies have a real responsibility to the community they belong to. Companies aren't only committed to their shareholders but also to all the stakeholders with which they have to deal: workforce, clients, local authorities, people living in the neighborhood, state. Doing good for everybody, including the disadvantaged people, is the core value of the free market economy which have always been related to philanthropy. American capitalists, who set up powerful foundations, are perfect example. In fact CSR is a new word for an old concept: Charity. The time has gone when the wealthiest simply donate directly to people in need.  Time has come when legal people do what natural people did.%% Thats what CSR make possible nowadays.

I didn't have a lot of experience in my job, so I was afraid that if I got fired, it would have been difficult for me to find another job. Fortunately, my career hasn't been affected by the crisis. However I don't think that I will remain an accountant for the rest of my life because it is the same task every day. That's why I feel a little bored sometimes. As soon as an opportunity to get promoted is offered to me, I would take a leap and do my best to succeed and, why not, to be promoted again.

      French is my mother tongue. I remember when I was younger, I didn't understand anything in english. I said : &quot;one day english language will be my second language!&quot; In France, school try to initiate english tongue at the beginning of school. But it is not interesting and when you are young you don't realize this language is mandatory to have a better life for an international job or spend times with friends comes from all around the word. I recently moved in Australia and I spoke really fluently english for looking for a job and to be more sociable with australian people. But I knew that I will not understand all what they said. That's why , when I came back to France last summer , I joined &quot;englishtown&quot; to be better and make english my second &quot;native&quot; language.

      Hi!The survey, generally, indicates that the most popular programs are &quot;News & Weather&quot; and &quot;Movies&quot;. My age group is between 19 and 30. And as far as I'm concerned, I prefer soap operas and Reality TV, as the survey shows it for my age group. The ratings underline that talk shows, cartoons and game shows are the programs the least watched. I disagree with for the talk shows, which are for me very interesting. They are a part of the news. I'm a female student and it's true that I watch more the TV in the evening and i prefer romantic movies. So, I think that this survey is rather good!

All people will have an electric car who can go over 300 kilometers between charges. We will use sun and wind to produce electricity instead of coal or oil. The scientist will develop some new robots in order to help us in our daily works. Our health will be better in the future, because the scientist will use nano robots to replace the medicine.

The smell of sweeties, the sound of music, ethics things .. is a magic moment. but I suggest you to go early in the morning or late in the afternoon because the central part of the day is too hot.

      Our government today wants to give equality between male and female by starting a teaching to the youngest children of France which would rub the differences of sexe between them, i.e : asking : do you think a boy or a girl can do this or that? do you think boys can wear rose t-shirts and girls blue one when you were babies ? Do you think boys can play dolls, and girls can play war soldiers ?...And so on... The problem in this teaching is that it goes so far, that after they suggest to the child that his physical sex is not his gender, and that he can choose his sex. I even red that in some north countries with the same teaching, it happens that adolescent ask for operation to change of sex. This is a real problem of repair against our natural identity. This teaching has been tried in north countries like Sweden, and it appears that it didn't rub disparities between men and women yet. It is true that there are differences between male and female, but i think we have to know them ans respect each one another. It is not by inversing the sexes that we will give equality.%% I think that equality births from respect of the values of the person equally from men to women. It's the question to recognise the same value to a man and a woman, even if they are sexually different. Each creature, each person has right to the same dignity. But, it doesn't mean that a man is a women. and the alliance of both is necessary to create a family. it is a way of accepting the difference and the complementarity which creates life. It's true that most of the time, salary is not equal between male and femelle, why? Is it because it might cause absenteism for the company due to the fact of being pragnant ? I think that women ought to be recognised by an equal pay for their equal work.

      In my opinion, the TV in France is as violent as in other countries. We can see lots of detective series, murders, many violent images in news... I think it is the reflection of our society with too many wars, fighting, anger between people. it is important, to care for children, to preserve their innocence and to respect the age rating. It is also possible to find lots of educational programs on french TV because it exists lots of channels. But, many of them are little known. We need to talk more about these programs which are entertaining and educational.

      As we can see in the line graph, the sales figure for best books company has recently the downtrend in both national and international market. For the national market, it created a highest peak about quarter 1 2007, then began sharp decrease until now. The peak of international market appeared sooner the national market at the middle of 2005. Then it decreased to half of 1 m since 2007. The company has a very successful at the beginning in 2004. Especially in international market, it sharply increased until 2M after 3 quarters. The national market has a slower development, it had 1M after 1 years but the increased trend is longer than international market. This growing had lasted until 2007; it reached almost 3 M (higher than the peak of international market about 0.5 M). By the way of conclusion, we can see that the sales figure level for quite a long time for both international market( from beginning of 2007) and national market ( from the middle of 2007) so we can predict that the situation of the company get worse and worse if the leader wont have a changement in their policy

      One month ago, I attended a presentation during a commercial event. The subjet was e-mailing strategies, and particularly how to make a client going back to your website when he left it before purchasing. Because we know it's much easier, and less expensive, to keep a client than to find a new one. The presentation was very interesting, but the speaker encountered a problem with his microphone; fortunately he had a loud voice so we could hear clearly what he said. He showed us very compelling flowcharts, explaining their meaning for people who were sitting in the back of the room and didn't see well. By the way, I must admit that I forgot the key points of his presentation; I think he should have summarize them in his conclusion. I talked with several people when leaving the room and everybody thought the same; we would have remembered it better if he had showed us again at the end his first flowchart, detailing the differents steps of the subject.

      In France, it is usual to have tests very often, in all subjects. I am totally all for that kind of system because teachers cannot make their decisions only on a few tests. I find it hard for students who fail a grade because they fail one big test. I also totally support the fact that people can have courses online, especially if they already have a job. They can study whenever and wherever they want, according to their goals and personal schedule.

      29th November.I just ate in your restaurant and I'm very disappointed. I took a salad for the starter, there was lots of pepper on it. I couldn't eat it. Then I had a deep fish fried with French fries. The fish was a little bit oily, but ok. French fries was really too much salty. The red wine was sour. The apple pie was disgusting. It was tough and too sweety. To finish I couldn't drink my coffee, it was so bitter.I'm a very unhappy customer.

      Mister McDonald, I'm writing regarding my request for the overtime payment during the two last week-ends. As far as you are concerned, my contract with TransWorld Enterprises clearly states that I should be compensated for weekend work. Furthermore, I had contacted my lawyer and he confirmed me that nothing in the contract would allow the company to refuse to pay me for something that was not your fault-talk about taking the moral high ground! Consequently, I demand you to pay me for working the two weekends. Therefore, I am within my rights to object to being refused overtime pay, and I can sue you for damages. Best regards, BC

      Office politics is not something you only have to face in your professional life: it starts at school, at the very beginning. We have no choice than playing the game, unless you can say good bye to your career. People always try to be in good terms with the top: teachers, boss, influencial people, that's a way to be recognize not only for your talent, but also as a socialite, the person who want to have in your close circle. there are different techniques for that: listen to what people say, learn how they behave, what they like.. That's not a big deal, but I don't like it: obviously, it's not sincere or rather friendly, just a way to use people to improve yourself, that's not a valuable tactic, but life is a jungle, if you want to be a good part of it, you can have a lot of talent, but charisma is not bad too!

      My first boss was a real leader. He was still young when he hired me, and all the members of his team barely were 5 or 6 years older than him. But he inspired the respect. Not by frowning nor yelling. He was very calm. He knew the qualities and weaknesses of all his engineers, he knew exectly what each would be good at. We were allowed to meet him at any time, and he was a man who really listened to us and told us what to do when we were in hard situations. Once, on the spur of the moment, I decided to quit the company. He was surprised but accepted my resignation. One year later, on an evening, he called me at my new office. &quot;Don't you get bored there?&quot;, he asked me. I did indeed. And he hired me again, for a better job than before. I was proud, I knew than he hold me in esteem, and recognized my skills. Then I lost him, he was sent somewhere else, and so was I. But, about 20 years later, I received an invitation for his retirement party. And there were all my old colleagues... A faithful leader !%%

      When I was growing up, tablets lap-tops and cell phones didn't exist. To search any information like address or phone number we had to use &quot;Minitel&quot;, there was one phone per home and the computer was considered like a luxe item. In the late 90's, appeared the first cell phones and computers. I recall that the both were really heavies, also internet connection was totally unknown. Over 10 years, we've discovered more and more kinds of media, the cell phones became lighters and smarters. Computers have been replaced by lap-tops. In the early 2000's , is arrived a huge wave of technology: Tablets, smart phones, internet connection, on-demand TV, HD TV. Nowadays, you can get any information anytime; anywhere; where you want; where you need.  It's so easy now to get access to internet, it's really difficulft to imagine how could we do in the past? This technology is totally integrated into our daily life, we can't live without it.

      Here are the list of questions I would like to ask people for my survey: Have you ever had the feeling to be discriminated in your day life or at work? Do you think you earn the same salary as your opposite sex colleagues for the same work? According to you, where is the main place that discrimination is the more important ? Do you think there are countries where discrimination against women is more garish? Does your boss try to avoid discrimination in your society? And how can he do it? Disabled people are often discriminated to find a job or just in their day life to move , what is your opinion and have you ever been a witness of such a situation ?

      Paris is very well known for its variety of architecture. The haussmannian architecture is the most spread throughout the city and represents 60% of the buildings. The city owes a major deal of its beauty to Geoges Haussmann. One of the most touristic city in the world, the places that are the most attractive are buildings or monuments such as: The Eiffel tower, The Arc de Triomphe, The Pyramind du Louvre, The Georges Pompidou center. Among all of them, The best of the best is the Eiffel tower which is the most daring architecture with its 324 meters height. Beside this there is the business area of The Defense where are situated not only modern buildings but also the tallest in number. Each building differs from one another in shape and style but everything is well suited to give a splendid sight to the overall. At last, an important place is also given to parcs. That's why everyone can take pleasure to have a walk in the tuileries or the Luxembourg gardens.

      The author is literally making everything as easy as make yourself a coffee, by explaining step by step the process of switching career.The main point he wants to point out is that your job will be likely appropriate than others depending on your ability to describe your character and hobbies. he suggests to take time to figure out yourself and to take note of how you behave outside your work hours. Not to be afraid of switching career path is made understandable by the survey he brings up, that most people had to change their career path 4 to 5 times.This book is definitely uplifting and encouraging to anyone in this position, and making you feel like there is finally someone you can relate to. Practical and well-done, I recommend this book for it's already success in the world of careers.

      I think the question of CSR is very simple and it's suprising that it could be a divising issue. On the one hand, companies are taking all non sustainable ressources on earth for obtaining big profits. What more natural they pay back for that, in giving a better life to society? On the other hand, when companies argue they have nothing to do with society's problems because it's it'the government's job, they are not logical with themselves. If we sould follow their rules, governement would be without public interest! The market is only the one to rule everything. No need goverment and all its regulation! I think all these speeches about morality in companies are funny and really naive. Howether, I recognize CSR is pragmatic, like all the anglo-saxon culture: &quot;A well paid worker is a good worker&quot;. Good! Good for them! Good for the company! But I think we forget the real meaning of life, the respect of the planet we have to give back to our children. Not a question about companies but a fundamental question about real human rigths.

In the meantime I watch TV less than 5 hours a week. What about you ? I think talk about TV is at a total loss. A lot of young people like me spent most of their time on the Internet.

      The French Budget Minister guilty of Tax fraud! (Headline) The French President claims that he didn't know anything about the tax fraud scheme set up by Jerome Cahuzac. (Subhead) The recent scandal revealing that Jr'me Cahuzac, the opinion was deeply shocked, said the Minister of justice, because that disappointing revelation concerns the Minister in charge of the budget and as a result the main person in charge of the control of the tax frauders. The polls have shown that the citizens don't trust their politicians anymore. Eric Meyer, tax lawyer associate at Baker &amp; Mckenzie, claims the hypocritical behavior of the current government, according to him, Francois Hollande couldn't ignore the fraud scheme and as he knew that the scheme was going to be disclosed, he just put Cahuzac as the whipping man.%% Finally, the French authorities are going to strengthen their procedure of control in order to reduce drastically tax fraud.

I suggest you wake up early and take a breakfast in your home before going. Second, when it's time for lunch, I think you should prepare something in your home. Third, when you meet your friends, you can have fun without spend lot of money in some best restaurants. You could have a little drink for example in some bars. Finally, all these suggestions could make you earn some money. I know there are big sacrifices but you need it at this time. Hope it could help you. Fabrice.

The main symptom of claustrophobia are breathing problems, fainting, racing heart, shaking, sweating I can give you some advice on how to cope with this phobia The first one is the cognitive behavioral therapy. The goal is to train your mind towards a more positive and rational way of thinking. For example you can go in an enclosed space with the therapist for see that there is nothing wrong. The second is medication. Drug treatments can be used to help you manage your symptoms like anxiety for example. That's all for now. I hope that it helps you. See you Linda

      I used to not think about life too much. I mean, I was happy and everything, but I never really thought about what was important. That all changed last year when my mother died. It was completely unexpected. She had a heart attack, and that was it. It took me a long time to deal with her death, but in the end I actually learned some valuable lessons. My mother lived every day as if it were her last. She never wasted time worrying or being angry. She always tried to see the good and be positive. She told me to do the same. What I know now is that every day is, in fact, very important. Every day is a gift that shouldn't be wasted. My mother didn't waste time on stupid or unimportant things, and I'm not going to either.

      Wall Street is a film of Olivier Stone, made in 1987. It was about the ''golden boys'' on stock market in late 1980's. The evil speculator, Gordon Gekko, was played by Micheal Douglas, and the good stockbroker, Bud Fox, was played by Charlie Sheen. In the begining, they co-operated to speculate on a stock, but later, Bud discovered that Gordon cheated him. The film was a tribute to Stone's father. It costed 15 millions dollars. In my opinion, the acting was great for both stars.

      I became aware of the cruelty of office politics when I begun working in France.It had been linked with my immigrant's background , my accented French and may be cultural differencies....I'm not very interested in office politics ,but I have to play my game. It depends of your colleagues ,but very soon offices games are deceptives and insinceres.Unfortunately ,those who excel at office politics usually enjoy successful careers.Some people play dirty .Indeed ,they will stab in your backwhen you least expect it.That's why you should find a mentor,ideally ,the mentor should be your employee or your boss.A mentor can advocate for You ,likewise ,you can support your mentor. It's a mutual advantage,useful for both.You should seek advice from your mentor. Finally,if you have problems with colleagues ,never humiliate them,rather ,show respect.You may be worried about collaborating with unfamilar colleagues .In the same way ,they may also ,like you,have difficulty being part of a new team.It's important ,as you mingle as within your circle of influence as without to show respect and kindness to people.Listen to your colleagues .In turn ,they'll listen to you.%%Relationships aren't always simple at work ,so when you have something awkward to communicate ,talk to the person about it privately.

      In France, it has been applied a law forbiding to smoke in public areas like restaurant , bar, train bus station , transports and school. This law has been put in place the first February 2007. We can consider this law has been well accepted by french people. Even if this hasn't dicreased the number of smokers, this law has had a real benefit for all people. No-smokers are not longer troubled by the cigaret's odors and now smokers couldn't consider now to smoke in a bar or in their office. In my view, this kind of law is really usefull for our society ,  when this law has been applied I was smoker and I've never considered this law like unacceptable but like a new way of life. From my point of view the persons who haven't yet accepted this law and carry-on to criticize are too addict to the the cigaret. Their drug is most important than their neighbours, childrens or friends' health.

      I recently saw a video presentation made by a philosophy teacher. I'm impressed how the speaker reaches the public interest. First, he have presented the subject and the key points very well. Then, he began the presentation with a concrete example that everybody can understand and think about it. Moreover, he often asked the opinion of some listeners which have different way of thinking. This point made the presentation more accessible. On the other hand, he didn't use a lot of charts and summary so it made the presentation sometimes difficult to follow. If he had used more slide for the presentation, I would have remember more concepts. Overall, the presentation was clear, well done and very interesting. But I regret that the teacher doesn't go to the bottom of things and doesn't give us a solution or at least a partial solution.

According to 55%, the accents from the Midlands area of the UK are the most disliked; for the others it's the accents from Liverpool. The favorite accent is standard English for 6 people out of 10 and Scottish for 35%. At last, only 6% think they have no accent whereas 4% have a very strong one; for nearly 3 quarters of the people, their accent is found to be moderated.

      In my opinion, the french TV is quiet. The programs are adapted to different people. No more sex scene or violent program. Most shows have 20 to 40 minutes of commercial ads. I think that TV in my country is good, the rating system is easier and the channels are interesting and educational. Lot of people to watch french TV in France but too Switzerland, Canada, England, Japan... Etc. all around the world with the technology, internet, TV sat. The offer are very important in our society.

Either my mom. So we really loved it! As soon as we finished the main course , we both ordered tiramisu . Thats was unbelievable! The food was a bit fat and heavy , but it was exactly what we desired, as it was a typical italian traditional dishes .

      I have always been interested in technologies. Therefore I have always followed the technological evolutions which are naturals for me. I have never had the feeling that these technologies changed radically my life. My life has evolved with the technologies with harmony. I have never had the feeling of a jump or a hindrance to cross. In the middle of the eighties when appeared the first computers PC compatible, I bought one for writing course materials for my job. It allowed me to work at home. In the middle of the nineties, when Internet appeared, I had a connection and I could find many people I couldn't find in real life. I bought a mobile phone because it was more practical than landline phones. Then came Smartphones, tablets and 3D printers, the speeds of communication have greatly increased. But I think all these evolutions are only evolutions not revolutions.

      Dear Sir, First of all, I would like to apologize for the lunch we had last week. This restaurant will never be booked again for meetings like ours. We were ignored by this impolite and disgusting waiter and the courses were awful. This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable. Nevertheless, I would like to make an other appointment to have the contract signed. Next week is perfect for me. Therefore, I would be glad to organize it at your own convenience.

      Le Petit Journal is my favorite restaurant. They serve very delicious Breton crepes. They have salty crepes as entrees and sweet crepes as desserts. The crepe named &quot;Complete&quot; is composed of eggs, hum and cheese. It's very simple but excellent. The prices are very reasonable - most crepes are between 5 euros and 10 euros. This restaurant is kept by a old couple who is very friendly. They have also a very lovely cat.

I just said : &quot;How are you?&quot;. I was like a kid before a gift. In reality, my star was more tall than the TV. He seems to be believe yourself. I felt that this person lived things a lot, even often, difficult things. He often works with numbers. In his past life, he had done surely mistakes, intentional or not? The money was changing the people's belief. it is not the only people who did mistake when we work much money. In more, He often falls in love, if I can say it. He travels a lot, I don't always understand how I met him. Here your name : &quot;Dominique Strauss-Kahn&quot; Are you fallen in love as me to you?

      Thank you for sending me that interesting survey about television. But you already know that I'm not really fond of television. It' s said that in my age group (46/60) we prefer watching news and weather. I agree with that even if I prefer to look outside to see what the weather will be like. The survey says that cartoons and soap operas are less popular. I agree with that too. I never watch that kind of programs and really prefer movies or documentaries. It says that there are no differencies between male and female, I don't agree with that.

      Dear friend, When you will come in Canada, don't forget to respect bound principes. You shouldn't yell in the street, it is inappropriate. You must not smoke in every public locus, because it's against the law. If you stay in a big city, you shouldn't go out alone at night, because it's very dangerous. When you visit a Canadian family, you should always bring a little gift, but be careful, you shouldn't stay too late, it's impolite. The grace is same in the whole world.

According to her he was driving her mad , he used to shout at her when he had drunk and even hit her. She is extremely affected by her act. She didn't want to kill him. A next door neighbour gives confirmation to Surina's sayings. He says that Dave was unstable : sometimes kind and loving, the moment after aggressive and violent if he was drunk. He always regretted his fits of anger. The witness saw the incident from his window. They were arguing one more time when Surina thrust a knife into Dave's chest. This one tumbled on the floor. Dave's mother's statement does not exactly tallies with the former testimonies. She never speaks about her son being a drunkard able shouting and hitting his wife. On the contrary she affirms that her son was an ever kind and loving husband. She was in the bathroom, everything was peaceful when she heard a scream , rushed into the kitchen and saw her son bleeding on the floor. She says it's a deliberate murder;

      I graduate from university. I'm barrister. Prior to work in energy sector, I was working for a law firm for eleven years. Successively,  I had been a tax lawyer and  associate of the firm. In 2008, one of my strong client, a switzerland company asked me to joined us for developing their activities in France. It was not only a new but also a great experience. New, because it had been different than my legal activity and great because I never made as much investment during my life. Indeed, I bough energy plants for more than one hundred million in six months. Unfortunately, my company merged and it had been the beginning of difficulties. I decided to left my company in 2010 to work in SERHY. It's a small company but it was interesting to implement industrial process. I would have stayed in this company but the bubble burst. Currently, I look for a job and it's the reason why I would like improve my english. If anyone call me for a job, I hope the market picks up. I will open my own company.

      The last couple of years have been difficult for my country. The biggest factor was that the bottom dropped out of the financial market, and a lot of people lost their jobs. Most people were happy just to keep a roof over their heads and food on the table but it was very difficult. Some of them didn't have a lot qualifications and started to work at 16 years old. So when the crisis came , they was shocked out ! They could pick up some little job but it was not really enough. Things are looking up, but I think people will be thriftier in the future.

      My lifestyle? Really? I don't know if it's the mid-life crisis, but I am feeling totally burned out and I feel something is missing. For instance, as a reaI workaholic I let work influence all my decisions, being bachelor, having a social life, practicing sport, eventually as a jock... I don't have to complain because I have everything I need and more and I absolutely don't leave from paycheck to paycheck. My life is hectic and demanding, but regularly, I really dream of having a more soothing life, with time for thinking about what I want, reading... That's one of the reason for those I want to improve my English quickly, because I am about to change my job and I need to speak languages for the further work I want. I hope my job satisfaction will way up after this change and that I will be able to have more social life.

      - You've been coughing a lot and you now have got sore throat but don't want to drink syrup ? You just have to drink a spoonful of honey and ginger. It's good for your throat and will stop the cough. - You got fever and don't want to see a doctor ? Soak your socks in vinegar and wear them, you will feel better quickly. - You've been eating something wrong and vomit, or you're pregnant and have nausea but don't like injections ? Chew ginger and raspberry leaf or put them in your tea. It's a miracle medicine.

      Last February, there were several storms in France. These storms associated with heavy rains, waves up to 12 metres high and strong winds of up to 100 km/h have made all coastal areas of the western France vulnerable. But the heavy rain has also increased levels to rivers in Brittany. Several towns were badly affected and flooded. Several of them were under 60 cm to 100 cm of water for several weeks and homes have been evacuated. Around 60 houses have been completely flooded and local schools have been closed. The storms have also left around 55,000 homes without power in western and central areas of France for several days. Fortunately, there was no human victim but the material damages were considerable.

      Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing about the possibility to request a loan to open a mortgage in order to buy the house I am currently living in. It will not only be cheaper in the long run but it will also build equity and bring sense of stability. I think I can afford it as I currently earn $2000 per month out of which $800 represent renting expenses. In addition, I put away $380 per month into a savings account with high interest and leave about $100 in my checking account for emergency. I would be grateful if you would consider my request. Therefore, you will find enclosed a detailed budget outline. Please do not hesitate to contact me for further information (tel. #########; e-mail: xxx@yahoo.com).

      Video on demand on TV has affected how I see moovies. Before, I used to go to the cinema. However, as it was too expensive, I had only be going to the cinema around twice a year. As a consequence, I was not able to talk about recent moovies with my friends. Now, with video on demand on my TV, I can rent a moovie for a price not exceeding five euros, including for recent moovies, and I can stay home watchinginterresting moovies in my sofa. That has definitely changed the way i see moovies. I have to say that I still go to the cinema from time to time.

It took about 12 calls with the therapist. But, you know what: last year I have made a bungee jumping, my fear of flight was away!You really need some help, don't be ashamed of your phobia, tell a therapist about it and you won't need any medication.I really trust in you.Friendly.Marie-Franoise

      The first sale has a wonderful view. The cottage has been recently renovated Its not in Ionian but Ithaca Island Its just 1 bedroom and the blight family needs 3 bedrooms I cant propose this cottage.  The second sale: Seafront Located in Kioni and not Ionian.  Does need some restoration and the blight family doesnt want to renovated so I cant propose this sale Spacious with 4 bedrooms The third sale: 3* 2 bedrooms with Vathy bay views Located in Ithaca and not Ionian. New residences so dont have to be renovated. I think its ideal, the single disadvantage is not located in Ionian.  The fourth sale : Ithaca Close the beaches. 3 apartments and 1 Studio I thing that the better investment is the third sales for the Blight familys.

Conclusions: - Not enough market research were carried out, before launching. - According to general opinion: we have a good idea but a bad execution. - We were not enough aware of the diversity of styles and tastes in different parts of the world. Recommendations: - We should request more research in order to understand better what men want and need in an accessory. - To adapt the product to the consumer, it should be made with leather,  black or white, more sporty and bigger. - As current design doesn't produce much enthusiasm in Asia, some changes could be acceptable too.

      I am a general practitioner in France. I have another job, because I manage a national association working around health organisation in primary care. My wife is also a doctor. She works with ultrasounds for pregnancy women. We have eight children. The two youngers are still at home, because they are forteen and fifteen years old. The six others have finished their studies and they work now in differents jobs. We are lucky because we earn enough money to live how we thougt we would do. We have a house we have made built five years ago. It's quite new and comfortable. My life is hectic and demanding with my two jobs, because I very often travel in France by train or by plane for my association. I spend one or two days a week in Paris to meet people at the Health Ministry or at other institution. I like this life. I think I will go on one or two years before changing my lifestyle.

      I would like to talk about scrabble. It's a word game. You have to find words with se'ven letters you disposed. Then when you have put a word on the game, the other team has to find a ord with the letters it is composed and with the letters he has. You are not allowed to put a word besides another word if there no common letter. It's the team which has no either letter to put on the game which win.

      France, is a country well-known for it's wonderful and mostly old-fashioned architecture. The towns of France make you travel to another time. There are a lot of Renaissance, gothic and Baroque architecture , particularly in the historical buildings such as St Peter's Basilica, Notre Dame or several castles throughout France. Paris, it's first city, is the perfect exemple of the melding of architectural styles, there are a lot of classical and antique buildings where people still live. However there are also a lot of modern and postmodern architecture, strangely enough it's not the youngest buildings but they really convey a feeling of innovation and modernism. The Louvre with it's glass and metal pyramid is really unusual and astonishing, people still cross the world to see it. And even if it was constructed in the 12th Century the use of metal was not the most beautiful material at this time. Finally, there is the Eiffel Tower, the tallest building in France with, 324m, entirely made of wrought iron and it's individual look. It's a really touristy building that I don't personally find beautiful during the day but at night, with it's thousands of lights it illuminates beautifully the streets of Paris.%%

      Last  week, my teacher presented to my classmates and I the new lessons. One thing the teacher did well was to use visuals and explain the key points. He is a good speaker, so, even if this new lessons looked like to be particularly boring, I had to admire how the teacher managed to add some fun in these difficults points. He spoke loudly and was quite clear in his explanation. His conclusion was excellent! A&quot;big finish&quot;! My clasmates and I had their socks off! However, I guess he could do differently a couple of things like the charts which didn't work very well because the black and white contrast making it incomprehensible. Also, I would have liked it if he was more specific about the key points which were complicated without some exercices to practise it. To me, the teacher did a great job and I think there's no need the change a lot of thing to improve his presentation.

At my age, my husband agreed to change  baby because women worked themself. To day some men stay at home to  bring children up whenever wife go working. What a groundbreaking ! In the item about Margaret Thatcher it's true to said that she was a feminist women. At the beginning of his career she was shy and gradually she take the head of  men.'s politique. Mentality evolue but much remains to be done, even in the most developed country like in french. In my opinion about equal rights between male and female  there will always one of the both will dominate the other. What a shame!

      It's was the first time I listened to this song by Josh Woodward called &quot;Home improvement&quot;. I never heard about him before. He is a sentimental singer. I don't really understand why he chose to talk about this topic, but it seems to be invested in it. I believe that he has written this song himself. The lyrics are pretty sad, so the mood of the song is sad too. The beat is quick and really addictive ! Now, I can't get it out of my head. However the song has kind of a repetitive melody, I think because the most important are lyrics and not tune. The singer hits sometimes high notes, in order to emphasize the meaning of the lyrics. He interpretates well this song.

      Dear Teacher, It's rather hard to speak about an awkward situation, however I will describe an issue that occurs in my job. I have worked in the French railways company from 2006 to 2009. It was a pleasure to discover this environment and these train projects. My costumers were relatively nice with me until a competitor came in our office.  He was nice but hypocrite and a so good commercial competitor. Because of his comportement, an issue occurs with a secretary. Six month later, it was necessary for me to be replaced by another consultant from my company. Four years later, the boss of my new company asked me to work again for this old customer. I was somewhat annoyed to meet again these project managers that I knew. What will they say about my comportement to my new employer ? Will they stab me in the back ? Finally, I have understood that's important to be carefull about what I say. But it's as well necessary to speak with these customer about my private life and to be more open. Every day, I say &quot;Good morning&quot; to each customer that I know and I try to talk with them.%% My aim is to show that I'm happy in my private life with a daugther expected in december. My comportement must be improved. I think that this strategy will works at work. Best regards

What is your domain of activity? (company product or service) If you were already pregnant, how was you come back at the office?

      In the past fifty years, technology has revolutionized the way we live. This has changed drastically in the last decade. With the advancement in internet technology such as mobile internet and broadband, we have more access to various form of entertainment, information and communication. With all these changes, the way we interact and use media, has changed. When I was growing up, I read news and books printed on paper. I used to buy newspapers for my father and borrow books from the library. I would read biographies, novels, magazine and how-to books. Somewhere along the way, I've changed my habits. I read my novels and news on my tablet. It's much better, because it's far easier to read when you don't have to hold pages. E-books for example, are easier to get than printed books. Instead of having to go out to a store or order a book, I can buy and download an e-book immediately. Mobility has become very dear and e-books have greater mobility and durability than paper books. To put it in a nutshell, many things have come and gone in this world.

The export director suggested that we replace quickly the sales manager based in Beijing by a more experimented person with a strong knowledge of the Chinese culture. Not all his team agreed with such a quick move and proposed that we forward the dismissal of the sales manager at the end of the next quarter as new orders shoulb be placed by two months by important customers. The CEO was on the same side of this export director and proposed that a new manager should be hired quickly. A new meeting was scheduled for mid January in order to study the applications of the different candidates proposed by our human resources manager.

Do you think that the Act has modified and improved the status of discriminated employees at work ? It is very difficult to find a job this year. Do you think that somebody who is victim of discrimation will be able to complaint ? He might fear to be fired. Do you think most people are aware of their rights ?

      Dear Das, I said to you I may retire in August. I decided to work 2 years in addition. It's too difficult to quit the world of the work. It's too difficult to accept becoming a old people .I prefer to give up the idea of a long hike and of all the plans I told you about. I am ambivalent because I'm fed up with my work. It's a bit hard for the 3 colleagues who hope to be appointed on my position. I'm sorry for them. Best regards. Christiane

      When I joined my company, 35 years ago, we had one telephone set for 3 engineers. Photocopying was not very usual. We were still using carbon copies. The big change happened to me in 1990 when my company introduced emails quickly after the use of fax machines. Then it was the move to cell phones which were limited to top executives and, after a few years, extended to almost everybody. All theses changes have dramatically improved our productivity but not our quality of life. All in all I wonder if we did not loose more than what we gain as employees and in terms of quality. This would deserve long developments. In my private life I must admit that tablets, smarphones etc...represent a fantastic opening to the world. I do not know how we could have survived so long without them ! On the other hand, I do believe that there is nothing better than a good old book that you read comfortably installed on your sofa.

      Yesterday, I was present at a very important presentation about the next team building.  The presenter who was my boss, was really compelling, not stressed and his voice was really nice. He looked at all the people around the room and I felt at ease and interested. At the end of his presentation, his conclusion was very clear with a summarise of the key points and a big finish. On the other hand, his flowcarts was not really clear and his serious was too much for the topic of this presentation. If he had introduced differently his presentation, I think more people would have been really motivated for the team building. In conclusion, the presentation was really interested and clear but he could more smile when informations are very positives.

      In my country there will be a new law about plastic bag in 3 months. Every plastic bags will be simply forbidden. This law is come because of the bad effect of plastic bag in our environment. In addition they soil everything in the town. For our economy, it could be a good idea, this law help our manufacturers of paper bags. They will have a great opportunity to growth their business and hire many people. In my point of view, I think this law will be very difficult to apply, because of the big use of these plastic bags. Everyone use it, when you buy something, the seller will put your product in a plastic bag without paying something in addition. Even if you buy a little thing, you will have a plastic bag. No one wants to break the law, but I am sure that we will have a lot of people charged with a felony because of this new law. In my mind, we will need a lot of time to be accommodated to this law

      There are a lot of waves tales about UFOS. The US department takes this seriously this story. It seems theres a restricted zone named zone 61 in the Nevada desert and the US department had captured a lot UFOS who are imprisoned. Dont ask me the question if this story is true or is just another unrealistic legend. Also a lot of people simple citizens continue to affirm that they have seen with their own eyes several UFOs flying in the sky and touch down near their house. There are also some people who talked directly without any translation to these UFOs. I think definitely ridiculous such belief but sometimes it can be useful to talk about these legends in order to let people using their mind and try to think if there are other kinds of living creatures around us. The real question is to whom benefits such legend? I have never found the right answer and perhaps it depends on what country were living.

      Is there equality between women and men in our country now? There is a difficult question. The men are now more often at home, they take care about babies and children, they are going to take them at school. Sometimes, men are cokking and cleaning the house. But, in fact, there is no total equality, at work for example. Women get less money for the same work and there are few women for example in politic things. In fact, I think that there are a lot of progress regarding the feminin condition, but we can't employ the word &quot;equality&quot; because there are differences.

      After getting back to my office , my colleagues want to know about what I had learned in the seminar *How to be a good leader* . It was very interesting because it shows clearly the most qualities that a good manager must have in order to manage a company in the best conditions . Firstly , a leader must know how to fling aside to difficulties especially in international worldwilde crisis and must take quickly the appropriate decisions . Secondly, a good leader must have a vision about the future and must set the goals with means of achieving . Thirdly, a manager must know how to envolve all his employees on the project of the company by introducing a performing systems of global management . Finally, a good leader mustn't forget that training is absolutely essential for him and his employees because everyone must know how to adapt to changes .

My laptop is so powerful that I can work whenever I want and wherever I am. Since I can join Social Network, it made me rethink the relations that I had with my friends. Immediately after I connected myself on a Social Network, I met again old friends that I hadn't seen for a long time. Finally I understood that this friendship was false and I made a sort through this new relationships. Internet has gave me the possibility to realize lots of thing like working on my english diploma and conception that is possible to make due to all the design software.

My story is different ! I was sleeping under a tent in the Pyrennes Mountains (South of France). In France you can have camping for one night where you want with an aproval. I have been waked up by a very strange noise not far from me. I love camping, alone an far from all but this time I was so scared that I couldn't even shout. It was a noise as steps of an animal. I couldn't do anything, so I did ... nothing but wait for a very very long time until the sun rise. The day after, I met two people speaking about a bear which have been seen recently. I have never kwown if it was my night visitor or not ! They told me bears never attacks human !!! But now, I never go camping alone; See you Marie-Franoise Sorry, it's maybe a little too long............

      Good morning everybody, Thanks for coming. As our HR Director said to you to introduce this meeting, I'm going to talk to you about our new process called &quot;People Review&quot; and its 2013 synthesis. Has everyone already been told about this process ? No ? Ok, to begin with, I'm going to describe the process. Then, we are going to look at the 2013 synthesis. We would like to implement a talent management policy and we necessary need to have a diagnosis of the performance and the potential of our each worker. So, we set up a table with data such as name, age, seniority, desire of mobility, manager's opinion about this desire, potential, performance, skills to to be developed to move on a new job, developement plan, plan development time, trainings to be needed, positions wich could be held by the worker, potential successor name... This table has been completed with our managers' help and has allowed us to set up the 2013 synthesis I'm going to talk about to you right know. This synthesis is divided into 4 main parts : Fistly, we are going to have a look at workers over 58. Secondly, we are going to focus on high potential.%% Thirdly, we are going to have a look at the low performers and then, we are going to focus on the potential successors for key positions and key people. Please, don't hesitate to ask any questions. To begin with, let's have a look to this chart wich shows us the number of over 58 years old employees and if we have potential successors to replace them when they will retire. Right, let's have a look to our high performers : as you can see, Mr H is one of our best employees and we have been told that is a target of our competitors. We need to set up a retention plan to keep it in our company and to motivate him. Then, let's have a look at our low performers. This chart shows how many low performers we have in our workforce. As you can see, the number of them have been decreased this year thanks to our progress plans. That's a good news. Now, weare going to focus on potential successors for key positions. This chart shows us that we need to think better about our potential successors. Who and how are the two main questions we have to consider if we want to anticipate some of our rsignations and retirements. To conclude, we could say that we need to work better on this topic because we haven't determined enough succesors for all our future leavings. Thanks for your attention. We have some time now for questions and comments.

      Change your life : remember our traditional medecine... Here are some of my granny' remedies. Especially during the winter season, you can have  fever ; you certainly have an infection. The best way to fight  it : get garlic and echinacea tea. Moreover, soak you socks in vinegar and wear them. It's so simple to do it. For a sore throat, you just have to take a spoon full of honey and ginger. You even can  take two spoons. Tell me how wonderful are this remedies. Granny will be so happy.

      Dear friend, Before your coming, I must to give you few recommendations. You mustn't smoke in any public building. It is against the law. Don't forget to bring a small gift if you will going in friends. Be careful if you stay alone at night in the street, in a big city in Canada. This could be dangerous. Also, a last thing, you shouldn't yell down the street to a friend. See you next week, Corinne.

      I feel strongly that there are too many reality shows in my country. Indeed, every day, we can see a show on almost all channels!  As far as I'm concerned, those kind of show are silly. Moreover, there is much sex or fights. It's pitiful and it's stultifying... Unfortunately, many children have access to these programs. We need to ask for more retrictions on them because there is nothing educational or interesting.  I think we should see more educational programs and documentaries.

      In France, there are some habits to respect. For example, it's important to be respectful to the elderly. We have to let them our place in a public place so that they could sit. However, I noticed that good manners get lost in the young generation. They spit on the street, they burp and they make so much noise. They become coarse and don't respect nobody. I find it's very sad. For a few weeks, I have moved in a new city and I'm surprised to notice that people in this town are very polite and nice. All of them say &quot;hello&quot; and &quot;please&quot;. Its very pleasant.

      We've been married now for 17 years. I first met my wife when I was working in a high school like a young teacher. One day, my car broke down and I put down it to the mechanic. He needed two weeks to fix it. Then I hadnt a car anymore to go at work. So, I asked for help to some colleagues. A woman, my futur wife, accepted to take me with her car. Since that day, we became friends. One month later, I went out with her. But meanwhile I had bought a new car which had worked well. We were married one year later and now we have two children.

      I've been working for 20 years. Therefore I can say that I'm now  able to easily identify office politics. Initially I was the one to pretend that office politics are not a game to be played. I was rather considering that our abilities are essential to get promoted. Now my opinion has been changed. I definitely consider that life at work is a game that everyone should play. Otherwise you will never be integrated into your company. Basicaly everyone should consider that there is time every day to talk with colleagues in order to improve our relationship. By doing this, we will be more appreciated by our colleagues who can advocate us once it's necessary. But for me it's an effort as it's not part of my personality. Like many people I tend to only talk to  persons I like working with. But it's a fact that everyone needs to be a &quot; team player &quot;. It's more an more one of the first crieria we take into account when we assess people ( yearly people review). I'd like to focus on one important point as well. Our respective bosses are all overloaded and once something's happening, negatively impacting results of our company for insteance, they like to consider comments brought by some people in the team.%% Therefore we need to have someone willing to advocate us when our name is put on the table.

      I have took my driving lessons for more than 1 year now. I have spent 3.000 for it. I regret to have spend this amount on it, because I don't care about driving. One of my priorities is to moving for Australia. But I am not broke. Actually, I have enough savings to plan my trip for 1 year. Obviously, I am glad I have found some jobs for almost 4 years because my parents couldn't help me. I was not comfortable about borrow them some money, so I decided to work when I get 18. We have some troubles but we have a roof over our head and food on table. I believe that in few years, probably two or three, it will be better for us. My mother will not have her credit anymore, and we would probably be able to consume as before.

      In France, the etiquette depends on which city you are. If you're in very posh neighborhood in Paris or in Lille, you should bring a small gift like a bottle of wine, a bunch of flowers or the dessert. In some cities you'll have to arrive early, in others you'll have to arrive 5 minutes later. Don't take off your shoes unless your host says to. Don't smoke inside the house, French people often smoke in garden or in terrace. People would appreciate if you offer some help. Don't eat quickly, take care of taste all the meals.

      First of all, i would like to pinpoint what success is. To my mind, it's when you reach hapiness helping the other to do the same. Moreover, to insure hapiness for a long time, we should find a good balance in the most important parts of our life (family, social, business). Once this enlightened, a successful person for me has first a vision (target) wich make him move in a constant way; secondly, failure isn't so much a problem for him and what helps to be resilient, persistent, is to juge a failure as an experience and surely not as a bad feeling of yourself. As well as you project yourself in the futur, you have to enjoy the ride as she said and to be present to the present: it means, to be aware of what happen now and therefore let your intuition work. If i summariz in one sentence, i'd like to say that if you listen and respect what you feel and think good inside yourself, you will do a very good job for you and for the others, in your job, family and social life.

      The last years, because of the world economic crisis, the personal finances of most of french people became worst. The biggest driving factor was that the bottom dropped out of the financial market. All the economy was touched and the companies activities decrased. Therefore people have lost their jobs and the unemployment figures have risen. So the income sources falled whereas the depenses and taxes grown. Today, an important number of people are still in unpleasant circumstances of having no job. Fortunately, even if the State's social depenses have gone down, the french people receive income when they are unemployment and most of the medical cares are free. Finally the situation isn't good, but certainly better than in lot's of other countries in the world.

      I think that the song, Home Improvement, of Josh Woodward deals with what's happening nowadays: society changes. He expresses his feelings against that evolution, which leads poor people to move far from city or to live in a mobile home as the rents are too expensive. This song is lighter and simple, with a pleasant guitar work. I find the music a bit too low and smooth and I rather prefer songs with more rhythms such as pop rock and hard rock music.

      In France, communication are a little special. The form of the expression depend to the context of the conversations. We often use an informal langage to speak with our friends, collegues or familly. But we use formal langage in many situation, when we meet a person for the first time for example. French are often quite direct when they wanna say something important. French langage is very diffficult to learn due to its grammar and all its expressions. The body langage is really important to, the topic of something we say can completely change according to the tonality or the face expression. We wave our hands to thanks, say good bye and to report our presence. To say &quot;hello&quot; we often shake hands for the first meet and a cheek kiss for well known persons ( more with girls). French use a lot email and phone to speak with others.

      It is quite difficult to discribe the future but i will try to give to you my point of vue. In the one hand, we may have a pessimistic approach. We will lack of raw materials, of food, of gasoline and maybe of time to imagine the best way to survive. On the other hand, science will make great progress and we will be able to care for all the diseases. But to put it in a nutshell, for me the major issue will deal with overpopulation and the ability to manage the flow relating to.

      Dear Elizabeth, Thanks a lot for these three images and poposition for our campaign. You have made a good job. Since the begening of the brand, we use the image of the sportive watch and we focus more on the man consumer and it work really well! The public consider our watches as casual watches. But today, for this new collection, i want more ! I want to surprise the consmer and i believe we should change our trading policy. I have decided that our new selling key is the smart watch which you must wear with the smoking or the luxury jacket for the reception. And i believe we must focus more on the women who wants some beautiful watches to wear with their dress and jewelry. And for this great changement i want use poesy and beauty. To that, i have chosen the first image an slogan :&quot; Century is a timeless beauty&quot;.

It was a bit strange but the environment was great.I was impressed by his empowered. I had been practising calligraphy during three years, nevertheless I wasn't able to do it like him. My level was still medium. Fortunately I was with a friend because the master wasn't speaking French or English. She helps us by translating our conversation.I asked him to be a trainee in his shop. He did accept. It wasn't very easy , but we find a way to communicate. I learned a bit of Vietnamese, I watched him a lot when he was writing and drawing and he was very patient. We exchanged by face's expression. I have been working there during one year until my level was better. It was a good experience to work with people who didn't have the same culture and the same language.

There are programs for the sport, for the news, to amuse, to educate or become enlightened, movies, programs for children and so on. Every person can find its &quot;happiness&quot; there. In addition to with satellite Channel, we can even have access to foreign channels.

I never watch sitcom on TV, but I do like reality TV. The ratings show that the following programs are least popular in my age groups are talk shows, cartoons and game shows. I agree with that.

      The acronym NAFTA stands for the North American Free Trade Agreement. It is a trade agreement between the North American countries of Mexico, the United States and Canada. Following long negotiations that started in 1986, NAFTA was finally signed 1992 by the leaders of the three nations. It took effect in 1994.The goal of NAFTA is free trade among the three countries. This includes removing trade barriers  for example, import tariffs or quotas. Supporters of the agreement say that it stimulates trade among the countries and builds closer relationships. Opponents say that it hurts domestic industries and only benefits the big corporations. Generally, the US has a goods deficit with its NAFTA partners; that is, it imports more goods from them than it exports.  On the other hand, the US generally has a services surplus with its two neighbors, i.e. it exports more services to them than it imports. As in any trade agreement, there are winners and losers. Unlike the EU and Eurozone agreements, NAFTA does not allow the free flow of people across borders. The three member countries also did not adopt a single currency. It is more of a simple trade agreement.

      I fell strongly that the French TV is one of the most boring. It is always the same kind of series, about drama and love stories. And when it is not the plot, it is about crimes. But the worst thing is not how silly they are, it is the acting... actors in these series are bad and the dialogues pretty dumb. I don't understand why there is no more educational program, or documentary at night. For me the prime time should be something that you can watch in family. With no restrictions for children. I hope the French TV will improve its programs.

      I have been an integrated logistic support (ILS) manager in the French Army since 3 years. Previously, I passed a master in ILS to reach that last job. Prior of that, I integrated the French military academy in Rennes. After, I'd accomplished my engineer degree, I went to the military maintenance school in Bourges. Afterward, I joined my first unit, the 7th maintenance battalion, in Grenoble as a platoon leader. I'd been staying there during 7 years and I went from platoon leader to head of compagny. Following that experience, I'd moved to Tours as an instructor at the logistic school. If I'd managed the entry to the military high school of strategy, I would have been immediately living in Paris. As I had failed, I moved to Bourges and was staying there during a year. Just before getting on the training for the master of ILS, I had to pass a last exam. For the future, I'm involved in the research of a new job. The economy could actually affect my career. I hope that the bubble won't burst again like in 2008 - 2009.

      Dear Mr Harrison the editor, First of all, I would like to thank you for spending your precious time reading my letter. I have recently decided to write to you, to tell you about my friend's horrifying story. It still happens out there, in our society and needs solving. Last week, as usual, she passed the Coffee Pot to order her coffee. When she got out, she saw a couple station their car in the park near Elm and Forth corner. They then left their car in working condition with maximum radio volume. Soon after that, they began to vandalize the local newsagents nearby. As a good citizen, my friend couldn't stand the scenery which was occuring before her eyes, so she decided to intervene. By her surprise, the woman pointed a gun towards her and then, suddenly, grabbed her laptop and ran off. Fortunately, there was a man who captured her by her hair. It appeared to be a teenage boy with a wig! I think everyone should be warned about that, because they haven't been arrested yet. It will be an useful article if you can post it in the newspaper. I will be at your service if you want anymore information. Yours sincerely,

I sit at a table with seven other colleagues. I was happy and I begun to joke. One of the colleagues asked me a question about his medical team work organisation. I answered withe a joke, then a second time and once again until I noticed he was embarrassed by my behaviour. The others colleagues were laughing at my jokes and I stopped answering in this way. I think I was way out of line. The day after, I saw him during the congress. I went and apologized for my behaviour. I asked him a lot of questions about his situation and we put down a date in our agendas to meet again and find a solution for himself and his team. I think I was forgiven, because he smiled me and we shaked hands before leaving.

      Hi Angela,Here are my ideas to write a blurb for the TT mag. First, there are three models of translators which are aiming at different clients. Both of them make easily learn a foreign language because of their dictionary , their useful phrases. One of them called &quot;Transformer Translator &quot; has more technical specifications as a world radio, a pedometer . So, we can learn a language in doing exercices or listening to the radio ! Moreover, those models are less weight than the ones sold by the competition. They are real hand-held products. We can bring them with you anywhere, can we? Most transformers have a free battery, we needn't to recharge it whatever you go sometimes abroad . The battery lasts long to work easily without any problem of connection.In a nutshell, there are so state-of- the -art and easy-to-use products. I'm sure we shoud win the clients' satisfaction even if we are in competition with other companies.See you soonPascal

      In France there are some rules of etiquette dating from the time of the monarchy. In this day and age, certain are still topical. Firstly, the cutlery are supposed to be placed at the right place: the knife at the right of the plate, the fork at the left. Secondly, you may not eating with the elbows on the table, it is very impolite because it gives the impression that you are boring. Finally, and this is probably the most important rule, you can't chew with the mouth opened, what is in your mouth not interest the others. Consequently, you can't talk when you're eating. On the other hand, don't hesitate to congratulate the host for its cooking and the decoration of the house. Before that, when you are arriving, you're supposed to bring a little gift, in general flowers, wine according to if the host is a man or a woman.

      I just heard the song &quot; home improvement&quot; by Josh Woodward. In my opinion I think it will be a big succes. It's a folk tune and it's really catchy. But also I think we can't over it because the beat is really quiet. Exatly like his voice. But his voice is so clear that foreign people could understand his song. The song's story is very sad and sentimental. I recommend stronger this song because it will be soon known.

      I think in France, we have no quite help for educations orientation. A lot of students are lost after high school diploma. They don't know whatever they to do want. And sometimes they continue their studies but without career goals. So I'm all for that students take a gap year after their diploma. But it's more and more usuel to take a gap year to make a trip between the fourth and fifth year of studies. This solution have a dsavantage : it can cost a lot...However, a gap year can have a obvious advantage of student's determination and plans.

      The model of society as we know it is doomed to disappear. The classic scheme of life was to work hard, earn a living, to borrow, consume and retire living. There is an urgent need to personal finances on hand. We are on the cusp of profound socio-economic changes which Westerners States and their citizens will face. These changes necessarily lead to new behaviors to adopt, especially in terms of money. The latest polls show a strong appetite for French to understand financial issues. It must be said that the impact of the crisis of sovereigh debt on their daily life are many : economic slowdown, obstacle to increasing purchasing power, rising unemployment, austerity...

      In order to improve my English, moreover my vocabulary, I usually read a lot of original material and I have written down some new words in my notebook. Thus, when I have the opportunity, I try to use them in a conversation or during my English class. Nevertheless, I wish I could talk more fluently and use those new words more naturally. Therefore, as I pretend definitely to improve my English in next months I have built a planning of studies. At least, each week I have to attend three English classes and complete a unit of exercises, and moreover talk in English as much as possible.Fortunately I could follow this schedule so far, and I hope  get better every single day.

      It seems that there's quite no performing art that's unique to France or if there is, simply I have never heard about it. However, since the middle of the 18's century, we can find in the city of Lyon a very special puppets theater called 'Guignol's theater'. Guignol is the name of a the main character who spends his time playing tricks to a policeman and often kick him from the back with a big stick of wood. The policeman is the funniest character. Kids who attend to the show like to laugh at that rude guy who never succeed to find Guignol. For the kids, these puppets are funny because it plays every time a simple story of a young, sympathetic, funny character (no more a child but whose behavior looks like same) who looks more clever than another one whom could be considered as a picture of the adults.

      The effectiveness of small remedies.For a sore throat, use a spoonful of honey and ginger 3 times a day. The benefits of this mixture allow to melt down the throat irritations. Would recommend for all the family.For bronchial congestion, make a poultice of mustard. This remedy is very strong. It is not recommended for children under 10 years. Let it to act 40 minutes on the chest. The mustard acts directly on the airways.For infection, eat a garlic and echinacea tea. Eat a garlic in small doses to avoid burning of the stomach. The combined effect of these 2 ingredients can reduce bacteria.These products are available on my website : www.grandmotherremedies.com

      I'm pessimistic about the future. I don't believe that the cars will fly and the robots will replace the human. And I don't believe also that the electric cars will replace the gasoline cars because that will be an economic crisis in the world. Maybe we will have some important innovative technologies in the future like cell phone without charges or other technologies that will simplify our life.

      Hi Renee, How are you ? Thank you for this survey, it's very interesting ! For my age group (19-30) the results are similar with my 'way of life' with TV. Even if I don't like sitcom, I love soap operas and reality TV like young people like me. For my gender, I don't watch many movies but I like horror movies like the other mens but I like too romantic movies like womens ! See you Jordan

      In the past I used to be very stressed all the times because I was always overwhelmed. My boss gave me more than I could do, and he always pushed me out of my limits. It was just a nightmare situation, consequently I had a burnout. The effects of this disease were a big chronic headache, a constant pain in my throat and my back. Furthermore, I was shivering and I was feeling totally frazzled with no energy. I was trying to overcome that with practicing some exercises but I didn't succeed so much. In addition, I felt depressed. It is a dreadful situation when you have the feeling that nothing could be done differently and that it will never end. I know that nowadays companies tend to go on in that way, I guess it will be always like that. In my future job, now I don't want to be stressed anymore. In the case of it might happened, I promise that I do not want to be as I was anymore. I realized that my health and my family are the most important things in my life. All of them need me more than an employer.

      Dear Madam, Dear Sir,Im writing to complain about your latest Blue Cruise Alaska, which I purchased and participated last week after reading your brochure. I was looking forward a spectacular adventure aboard a cosy cruise in middle of Alaska's wildlife. As we can read on your document, the ship would be cosy and comfortable but I noticed that the ship wasn't a cruise vessel but an horrible slow little ship. The cabin was dirty with ants, uncomfortable beds and disgusting bathrooms. Your captain was unfriendly and unprofessional and we just saw some eagles and none of wild animals promised.

      I'm surprised at how the TV programs are so stupid these days, for example the tv reality shows are very bad. These shows don't entertain you, they just make you in an uncomfortable position. I feel strongly that tv shows should be more respectable and really entertaining. Fortunately you have different channels with educational programs and they teach you about sciences and art. It's amazed at how TV can be so important for the people, I think it's too much stupidities and not enough education or entertainment.

Moreover, they're so cute because they're small and they got small hands and feet. Even if they're not very beautifull, monkeys are my favorite animals. Bye Kisses

      In France there are no classes on Wednesdays for pupils. So kids can have a break in the middle of the week, which is very important for their productivity, and they have their time to do other artivities outside the school. But recently, the french Government decided to do a reform of school system, and to add classes Wednesdays in the morning. Parents and teachers are against this reform, because children are very tired and have not any improvement. In my opinion, this reform is not a good one, because education must be adapted to kids' captivities and if they are tired and not productive, there is no reason to increase the classe hours.

      Let me talk about french health and safety regulations. Yesterday I went to a bar and saw many people smoking outside. I think it was a good decision to vote a new law to avoid having smoking and non smoking people eating in the same room. I also appreciate having possibility to take a bus with no smoke inside anymore. In the opposite, once you're walking in the street you may be arrested by policemen because they want to control your ID card. It's a bit too much , especially when you are a tourist visiting Paris. I understand we need rules to also protect us agains terrorism. But we also have to consider that people need freedom in their live and unfortunately we see that more and more things are now prohibited in our life.

      Blue Cruise Alaska Dear Sir, We were supposed to have a smooth and exciting trip but we had an awful one. Instead of having a cosy and comfortable vessel, we had a horrible and slow boat. Because of a problem engine, we have waited half a day to have it repaired. The Captain was unfriendly and not professional. Every morning, we were seating around waiting for him to wake up. It's not fair that we waste holiday time waiting for your Captain who was supposed to be professional and attentive. The cabin was durty, the bathroom absolutely disgusting and the bed uncomfortable, I got a terrible backache by sleeping in that bed. Where was the animals described on your brochure?, we just have seen eagles only. I ask you to pay back the amount of money I have payed for that nightmare. Yours faithfully Mrs Forquet Monique

      I recently attended a presentation about our company new procedures. It lasted about an hour, but I didn't find it too long. Indeed, the speaker was clear and easy to understand. His speech was told in a conversational manner, so it was quite lively and not at all monotonous. Furthermore, he used a lot of visual aids which were very accurate and helpful to have a better comprehension of what he was saying. Another thing he did well, was to summarize his key points in the conclusion. We were allowed to ask questions at the very end and he handled them well. The answers were clear, indeed. On the other hand, I would have liked it if he had given more explanations for the additional services. Another thing he could have done differently was to allow us to ask questions during the presentation, in order to keep our attention. Overall, the presentation was useful and given in a professional way.

This meeting took place yesterday, late in the evening. She proposed me a deal that simply can not refuse ! She wants our clothing brand sits in her own store. She saw all our new creations and she is particulary happy with the choices that we have made the designers. She wants an expensive stock because she is certain that sales will explode ! Value for money is very interesting ! We will meet again soon for that tell you more precisely that she really wants.

      Well, it's really hard for me to write about my personal finances. I quited the business world fifteen years ago, and became a &quot;desesperate housewife&quot; for a very long time. Of course, I managed to pick up several little jobs during this period, but my first objective in life was to care about my two little daughters, and spend most of my time with her. But a lot of things changed for 3/4 years. Unfortunately the bottom dropped out in my husband's business and our income decreased dramatically. Every month it was more difficult to pay our mortgage and simply afford to live decently. Five monthes ago I received some money from my family and this factor has changed my life. Now we have moved back to Paris and I intensively look for a job (studying english at home for example!). My daughters have growed up so they don't need me as more as before. I think things will soon turn up for us. Hope so!

      R is very serious person. She completely spends her time and her energy for the work of the group. For her, the most important thing is reaching the object with the group. Therefore, she tries to collaborate with each other. She shares her ideas and her listening skill is wonderful. She is willing to spend some hours or sometime all day to get the idea of the other. Ive almost never seen her aggression; she is very calm and tender. I wonder if she is a master of yoga or not. However, some times she is quite slow. I mean she has a little bit difficult to understand the discussion of the group. Maybe, her English is not perfect then she couldnt really get the idea of the other. Thats why she always listens carefully each word of our member.  Because she always concentrates on the work, she has a lot of creative ideas. This helps us to improve the quality of our product in many times. Sometimes, she is quite unreality, and I must take long time to discuss with her. By the way, she is really good member, Im very happy to work with her in the team.

      I think that a website should be easy to use and highlight the most production of its sales. Everything should be done in small click and be comprehensive. I strongly believe that when you have to search things and having the feeling of wasting your time, you lose a potential client. Furthermore, it is untrustworthy! People nowadays, order at their lunch break, and have no time to browse everything in the front of their computer. However, the website has to show us that we are making a bargain. A lot of website know how to compare all prices and to be an eye-catching to hook the future client. What if you buy a bad quality of the good , either not be able to return it? What if you have nobody who can answer to your complain? Finally, what if you have the feeling that your identity has been stolen by a con? Definitely, internet bring us a lot of comfortable way to save our time, and to compare all prices, but we should also have in our mind the possibilities to think that we might be stolen. It means that we have to be cautious and check every details when it occurs to us to be strange.%%

During these vacations, I've been also travelling. I went to Corsica, a small island in the Mediterranean sea. I took the plane from Paris and found a camping site right next to the beach. It was perfect, I swam all days in the see and had some walks in the mountains. I also made diving activities. South of Corsica is a famous diving spot with a place called &quot;merou ville&quot;. br/>I was fantastic.I was very tired before this vacations, now I can go working with a lot of wonderfull pictures in my head!!I hope to see you soon.Sophie

      I want to study on line because I have no many time and I'm not always free at the same hours  that it's very difficult for me to go in a classroom. Study on line allows me to learn where I want and when I want. I can study the night or  the weekend. I can move at my own pace and return to a lesson if I did not understand . I am totally free of my schedule.I would like to study English but also Spannish and if it was possible some software compability.At the end of my online study program I would like to speak English fluently because, actually, I'm unemployement and when I search for a work, more and more they ask to speak English very well. I find it's a shame to miss an opportunity because our language level is not good enough. Then I want improve it.

      On this assignment I will describe the website of amazon. I really appreciated this website due to the large range of products available. Indeed, we can find on this website products like books,garments,dvd... I think the website is really simple to use and covenient. The colours have been well picked and there are not frivolous elements on the homepage that I do not appreciated. Besides after subscribing to the website, it is quite fast to buy a product from the website. Compared to others e-commerce site, I would say that amazon's website is the most user-friendly. Indeed, I never encounter some particular problems on that website. When I want to find for instance a book in English I could type the title in the french version and the website will directly transfer me to the british version. I think is due to the fact that there are a great deal of people log in everyday on the website that it must be user-friendly.

      Will's first quality is his assertivity. Rarely seen such a young assistant able to say yes or no, to express his opinions so clearly, so quietly and so firmly. Also open-minded and cheerful. He can change his position, not because of any kind of influence, but in order to find a win-win solution. If you are looking for a negotiator, Will is on any matter the very man you need. Aware that he is brilliant, secret jealousy may easily arise amongst his colleagues. Especially because he is not as we could say a hard worker. Dont ask him for overtime, nor for teamwork !

Obviously, it's often a long fight, (but nothing is easy) The new laws protect environnement, permit the web development in the deep country and ,of course, permit to supervise elderly people for exemple , to keep in touch and so.....

In the maintain entrance you could find a special garden inside the skyscraper. It was very lightened place and when you entered inside you could feel the space with a lot of glasses. It was amazing to feel that in buildings. Even if I visited a lot of Paris and Geneva for many times, I don't think I will be able to find that same feeling. I felt something special. Not only the garden inside but this skyscraper was incredible. I tried to take a picture to the top and the bottom of this building but my camera wasn't be able to do it. Too hight!! Anyway I love so much New York, the atmosphere is really special and all this building higher make you feel as an ant.

      Hi Mister Gibson,Thank you for explainning  to me the skydive procedure. As the insurance policy says, I should not have health conditions.

      Dear Helen, If you want to study in France, you have two possibilities : the private business school and the universities. The private business school have advantages and disadvantages : quality of education, more financial capacities, but diploma not always recognized, too expensive for certain students. The universities have advantages and disadvantages too : quality and large choice of domains, less money for material, more flexibility with the schedule, less classes in the week but more homework and personnal work. So your choice depends of your education goals. Have a good reflexion and don't hesitate to search more informations. Bye Julie

      An area of about 8 meters x by 3 meters is marked as the bowling alley. Ten plastic bottles can be used as the bowling pins  they should be filled with a little water to make them heavier. The bottles are lined up in rows of 4, then 3, then 2, then 1 - just like ten-pin bowling. Each player is given a frisbee and is allowed to take two shots on each turn. Players are given a total of ten turns each. One point is scored for each pin that is knocked down. If a strike is scored (all the bottles are knocked down), then the player takes two more shots and all the points are added together.%% The winner is the player with the most points. Be careful, this game should not be played on a very windy day!

      Dear Sir or Madam,  I am writing to enquire about the possibility of requesting a loan. I would like to open a mortgage in order to buy the house I am currently living in.  I believe that it will be cheaper for me to buy than to rent in the long run. Not only will I also benefit from the property building equity, but I would also benefit from the stability of owning my own home and the freedom to make changes when needed.  Please find enclosed a budget outline including my income, expenses and savings per month. As you will be able to see, my finances should allow me to buy the house. I am currently paying $800 rent per month and believe I have an adequate income in order to afford the mortgage payments. In addition, I deposit $380 into a high interest savings account monthly which can also count towards paying back the loan.%% This amounts to a total of $1180 that I will have in order to pay off the loan.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need more information. You can contact me at xxx@gmail.com or ### ### ###. I look forward to hearing from you.  Yours sincerely, Me

If you commit a more serious crime like hurting someone being drunk, or having a car accident being drunk, you have to go to the court to be sentensed. They can decide you to go in jail even if you are not 18 years old, than you are sending in a juvenile jail. But if you have a good behavior you have not to stay as long in jail.

An employee thought it could be good for the company to invest into crops and cultivate our own plant to prepare our own essences. That created some jobs in the area.

      I can say that the evolution of media changes my life in many way. Indeed, I remember when preparing my PhD, I had to order my mail all the publications I needed for my work. I had to wait for several days, and once received I was sometines disappointed by what was inside. Nowadays, things are easier: with digital media, you can access to all the documentation you required on demand and on line. The difficult thing now is not getting lost in such an amount of data. The other point, you have to take care of is also tha quality of data. As every one can epublish very easily on website, or any forms of media, you have to be aware of the quality of the data. That was different when all publications were under peer reviews from publisher. But one of the very best thing is that the price to access to publications has terribly decreased compare to what it was just 20 years before.

Shareholders and clients are fully in a part of this company and they are welcomed for any opinions regarding the new logo.

      I grew up at the time of the books and the newspapers. It was also the beginning of the television. In the mid '50s, my grandfather bought the first TV set of our little town. It was a huge varnished wooden box with a tiny round-cornered screen. There were only two channels available, but passing from one to the other was a big deal. You had to change the direction of the antenna thanks to a motor on the pole, controlled from a device behind the TV set. Far from current screens, yes ? My parents did not buy a television as long as my brother and I were students. My father enjoyed his daily paper for the news and the cross-words . We would read much, at that time. I was proud of my collection of books. I must say that today I still have a lot of books on my bookshelves. An encyclopedia in 12 volumes, for instance, and many atlas. They are just decorating now and taking the dust. An encyclopedia, a geographic map cannot be updated, while your computer gives you the latest information on demand. Nevertheless, I keep reading novels and fictions on traditional paper books. I have not yet tried e-readers...

Take a frisbee and shoot twice each turn. You can take ten turns in total. You score a point for each bottle knocked down. If all bottles are knocked down, you can take two more shots, and add the points to your scored points. You win if you have the most points. But don't play on a windy day. It's dangerous.

      There a lot of different opinions about criminality in France actually.A lot of criminal activity links with drug dealing. One of this point of view that drug addicts need to be treated,cared for and encouraged to break the cycle of addiction-they don't need to be criminalised.But we need to take account of the fact illicit drugs markets are dynamic and the wider issue is not about light drugs(e.g. marijuana)-Class A drugs.Issues like cannabis farms and new psychoactive drugs also create social harms and attract organised criminality.On the other side opponents say that alcohol was responsible for not less crime and health problems than the illicit drug trade.Drug addiction costs a fortune,but it pales in comparaison to the depredation of alcohol problems. Drug policy is not working in France,we are not reducing the supply-we need a full debate on how to take this further.I hope that practical policy measures might be more persuasive than big-picture philosophising.

      Dear M. McDonald, I am writing regarding your answer concerning my will to be extra-paid for working hours I have done the two last week-ends to complete the work. I contacted my lawyer who clearly stated to me that my contract states that I should be compensated for weekend work. Furthermore, he advised me that nothing in the contract allows the company to refuse to pay me for something that is not your fault. As a matter of consequence, I should be paid for working at home the two last weekends. Therefore, I advise you that I am within my rights to object to being refused overtime pay, and I suggest we quickly reach a common agreement in order to avoid to sue the company for damages. I look forward to hearing from you. Sincerely.

      Hello Paula, Here are some advices that I hope will be helpful. First of all, I think it would be ideal to make your own coffee in the morning and cary it with you in the office. Thus, you can have it hot all during the day. At the same time, this will help your second issue: the lunch. Not having to spend so much money on coffee you will be able to have a bigger and healthier lunch. You will feel better and you will not need to eat so often during work. And you will see that at the end of the month the budget is going to bee more balanced. Thirdly, as regards your habit of hanging out with your friends and eating at expensive restaurants, it is clear that you must make a change. Try talking to your friends and explain them why you can't afford any more to eat in those fancy restaurants every night. They will understand you. Hang out with them a few times a week, spend lees there and wayt for you to arrive home to prepare yourself a good meal.

He learned me his best engineer had resigned two weeks ago so our project ran behind schedule. He need to hire another one with the same specific skills, but none of the applicants had convinced him at the moment. By the way, in order to take the project back on track, he demanded his team to work all around the clock. He forecast no more than two weeks delay. I am not so optimistic but I am confident in his efforts to meet this new deadline. I talk about this when I'll come back, tomorrow afternoon. Sincerely, Caroline

      Have you ever fancied being threatened with a gun by a young woman on your daily trip to work? Unfortunately, that is what happened to Meg yesterday! Sun was shining and it was the promise of a gorgeous day. So when Meg witnessed a young couple vandalizing the local newsagent at Elm and Fourth corner and tried, as a good citizen, to get them to stop, she was not prepared to be in response violently injured. A long-haired woman pushed a gun into her stomach, cursed her with insane words about evils of consumerism and then grabbed off Meg's laptop and ran off. Could you imagine how shocking it was for Meg! A passer-by tried to arrest the aggressor but only managed to catch a twig, revealing the woman was actually a teenage boy. At the moment, police is still looking for the two criminals and Meg is now scared to leave her house.

I already did the first part (presentation of the overall project and its objectives...) and I'm currently working on the achievements (with statistique table...). I think it would be great if you do the part on the financial reporting. You were in charge of the budgetary monitoring so I guess you've all the required elements in hand to complete it. But, Sam would like us to presente also the financial aspect of our local partners' development. To do so, you need to get in touch with Laura Martinez, our focal point in the NGO &quot;XX&quot;, she can gives you relevant data. I know the timing is short and I'm here to help you if you have any concerns or problems. Anyway I think it would be great to schedule a meeting next week. Let me know when you're free.

      I'm gonna talk about skydiving as since we've talked about it during the unit I feel kind of interested into it.  The most interesting part is the free fall, because it must such a rush when you just fall ! However you have to gave nerves of steel although you won't ever be able to jump out of the plane ! Moreover, I've always been a thrill-seeker, a little bit so it might interesting, nevertheless I don't know about the prices yet and I don't know if once in front of the plane I'd dare to go in. As a conclusion, this extreme sport looks kind of amazing, but if you wanna do it, you have to be a thrill-seeker and to have nerves of steel. So yeah, I hope I would be able to try someday !

      Dear friends, I am Flayo. Most of you already know me for my actions end investment in the Student Council. Today I come to you to ask you to vote for me for President of thic Council. My main action as a President will be oriented to the help of disadvantaged students. Rich or poor, any student should be able to take part to all educational activities.  Our old school is sad and old-fashionned. The study conditions are not optimal, as you know. I will convince the Principal to raise funds to give the premises a more modern and smiling aspect. That would be to the benefit of all of us, including the Professors. The restaurant issues will also be considered. By using the services of an external catering company, we could offer better means for not more than the current price.  The Students bedrooms should be refreshed and modernized. I have studied the cost impact of such improvements, and I tell you that that could be done without affecting the global fare. If you also think that our School needs to be modernized, vote for me for President next Friday.%% I count on all of you.

For me it's very hard, because you can work all the year and fall your exam.

      How to make a career out of courage- Judith WightIs your career path smooth for you? Are you content or suffuring from anxiety and boredome at work? I think in every situation, this book is a good guidance for you, either to help you being always motivated, or to help you get out of it more easily.Judith Wight, with her abundant experience about professional guidance, seems to be succesful when writing this book, where readers feel like having someone nearby, who understands them and sympathizes with them.It gives good advices for choosing a suitable career, to start, or to change. Her philosophy is that change it, or suit it, it depends on your choice, it's all feasible.Eventhough it is motivating, but to me, i'm not sure that it is plausible. Life is not as simple as we can see superficailly, or is it easier to talk than to do? I let you read and judge then.

Before you take such a decision, I'll advise you to find another solution. If subway makes you feel anxious, scared and trapped. If your heart goes racing, if you are sweating and you feel urgent to escape, I'll advise you to seek help from a medical professional. Many treatments are available now and you'll be amazed how easily you'll overcome your fear. Those treatments help manage the symptoms and don't mean necessarily medication. You can learn methods and techniques for dealing with your symptoms as meditation or breathing techniques. I hope you'll think about this. Don't hesitate to ask me more information and to call me. I'll be pleased to help you.All the best,

      I had a stupid accident twelve winters ago. I lived in a very big house with outdoor swimming pool. Each winter i had to empty the swimming pool and clean it. It was a very large and deep one and the bottom was with declivity from 1m to 2m50 in the deepest part. After a whole weekend to clean it i was very happy of my good job but some leaves stayed once more and i had to go in to put them out. It was a light rainy day. I was walking slowly on the declive part ... and i waked up. later.. laying down with a huge bruise on my head, a broken right thumb and some difficulties to see well. It was not easy to go out the swimming pool and i had to rest 2 days.

      In the future there will be more unemployment in Europe.  Companies will use more machines and there will be fewer jobs for people.  People will have to move to different cities or even different coutries to find a job.  Also we have a big problem with debt.  Europe will have more and more debt in the future because they will try to help the people who have no jobs.  In France, we have some big problems with the social security and all of the government aid that people receive.  I think there will be less and less government aid in the future.

      Fresbee bowling You must have an area of about 8 meters by 3. You could use ten bottles. With the bottles could you lined up in rows of 4, then 2, then 1, just like tem-pin bowling. If you touched them is as a knockdown. Each player has a fresbee and is allowed to take two shots on each turn.For make a point the player must knocked down a bottle. The winner as the most points.

      In 1984 my boss gave me my first computer: Macintosh 512K. It was great, this machine has changed my life. At the beginning, I used my Mac for word processing with MacWrite, calculation with Multiplan and drawing with MacDraw. As the years we bought more powerful computers and the color came with large screens. For 5 years I work with a laptop and since 2011 I use a tablet. This is the top for me: I use Internet wherever I am and, more importantly, I can organize my work with many more facilities. I'm an architect, for example, with FinalCAD application, I check my sites very precisely. Today I even listen to the radio and my podcasts in English with my iPad. I love it, and I'm addicted!

      Personnally, I'm not a thrill-seeker. But at many time, I took up opportunities to get up experience in extreme sport. First of all my experiences, I'm from the South of the french Alps. So when I was a kid, I began downhill skiing. Year after year, I used to improve my ability to ski. But I'd never been trying downhill racing. Sometimes, I have some regrets but I think it's too late now. I had a second experience five years ago. On my job, I had to work for a french airborne unit. As I'd conducted my mission very well, this unit proposed me for a skydiving jump. So I got in the plane with my instructor. The plane flew up to 3.700 m high. I was totally scared. We jumped and then... I felt totally free in the air. We had a sky fall during about 45 seconds. It was an amazing experience. I have had other experiences but I will present you in another exercise.

      I work in a French Firm. In France, I think there are two different work culture. In the first type, there is a culture which is based on the weel being of employees. In fact, people think that somebody which feels good is somebody who works well and better than an employee who is depressive. And in parallel, there is another type of culture which consists to optimize time and tools to be more profitable, but to the detriment to employees and their well being. I think I'm Lucky, because I work in a little firm where well being is important and where employees are sympathic.

      It seems to me that successful people have many points in common. First, they live their lives in a positive way. They never stand too long on negative points and always think about what should be the next step to succeed. Whatever happens to them, they are ready to bounce back. In addition to that, they are persistant, passionate and ready to adapt themselves (or their ideas) to the market's needs. Of course, they also have a strong need to be their own boss and need to do things in their own way. However, sometimes, you can meet people who have successful people's traits and habits but are considered by other people as &quot;loosers&quot;. Yet, when you talk to them, you are surprised to see they still believe in themselves, feeling that one day their turn will come up and they will be successful. To do so, they will need the only thing you have to get to be successful : the idea ! Without it, they will continue to be a successful person only in their own fantasy world.

He isn't allowed to speak us but he's allowed to open his mouth if he wants. He hasn't to use his legs exept for the last minute. He's allowed to act up for five mintes. If you have to guess the word, you only can give three answers. After three answers, you lose. This game is really good for the brain because we have to think a lot.

      When I decided to learn and to play classical music I knew that I couldn't waste time anymore. I learned piano very young and when I was twelve years old I changed for the classical guitar. That was deadly serious, studying a lot and performing later. I had a hard time but I never wasted time worrying and never gave up. What does matter, though, is that I became a professional and performed in concert. Every day was important and I learned how to maximize each one. Every musical piece is important and I do play as if it were my last music. The classical music repertory is way too large to all play and people who like this music is huge. I have to do my best to make people happy or to motivate others about this music. That sounds great to me because I found what works for me and I want badly to share with the most of people. If I should give an advice to young musicians, it'd be : work hard, don't waste time and never give up - what does matter is that you show your generosity and your feeling through your music.%%

Finally, I could take one other plane at 8.00am. I traveled in the A380. During the travel, I visited the plane. It's big and large. I watched movies, and read newpapers. I arrived In New York with delays, but without other problem. I just arrive at the hotel. I will rest in my room before take informations at the reception concerning the hotel and the New York city. My Holidays in New York begin! To so later. Martine

      Research shows that 29% of the 15- to 19-year-old women buy at least one magazine a month. In contrast, up to 47% of the 18- to 24-year-old men purchase one magazine a month. 69% of the first demographic group prefer magazines to blogs, on the other hand, 72% of the second demographic group prefer magazine supported by extensive website content. As both groups are almost the same size, it seems to me that expanding the young men group is more profitable since the market represents $242 billion compared to $153 billion for the young women group. However, the estimated figures show that by 2025, the first demographic group will be sharply rising. In comparison, the second demographic group will be slowly decrease.

      I my opinion, I think there is too violent scene on TV. The TV rating is very silly and concentrate its efforts only on sex. So the system allow the children to watch almost anything violent and shocking unless it's not about sex!  Anyway TV is becoming sillier day to day. I'd rather have a choice between documentaries and educational program than those stupid TV reality show. However, I can see some channels are adapting their program for an other audience and they're planning to put on more educational program.

      During our last holidays, near the Mediterrannean sea, we ate in a small restaurant, located on the sea side. The owner explained us that all sea food was fresh and the vegetables were growing, in his own garden. During the Chef was preparing what we ordered, we drinked a glass of champagne. We ate a douzen of oysters as an appetizer, with local dry white wine The main course was a ''Loup grill'' with baked potatoes with the same wine. ''Loup'' is the name of a very tasty fish. We didn't tak salad, prefering the local goat's cheese. We finished with a lemon tart then a coffee. As we drunk a bit too much, the owner said us we could we sat in deck chairs, waiting for the end of the afternoon. All was perfect!

      According to the author, it's usual to wonder about our choices in carreer, and people &quot;change a carreer path 5 to 7 times a lifetime&quot;. We don't really choose our first job and after some time we realize that maybe we didn't take the right decisions. But how to choose a job which can fit us? Which can make us happy? For him it depends on our personnality, interests and working style, and if we prefer to work alone, if we are creative... Then we can find the right job. It seems easy in fact; we just make some kind of personnality tests when we are teenaged, then we choose among jobs which one can fit us. Is that the solution, the way to make only one job in our life? Maybe for some people, but most of us will do several jobs anyway, people need to change, to do something new and not to get bored doing always the same thing.

      If you visit the south of France, it will be worth to have a stop at Montpellier. You will be intrigued by the architectural contrast that has been elaborated since the city's establishment, in the 10th century. The historical city center, built in early middle age, is a real labyrinth. You can be lost in the narrow streets which tell you the story of the city, through their beige stone facade houses, that nestle a number of well-maintained private properties, dating back to the 10th Century. You can also find 19th-century Haussmannian style buildings, standing around the main city square &quot;place de la comdie&quot;. The most impressive building at the Comedy square is the theater, its facade is exactly similar to the one at Opera Garnier in Paris. Antigone is the modern part of Montpellier. Built in the 1990's, it confirmed the architectural contrast of the city. The most dominant building in that area is &quot;Languedoc Roussillon region's hall&quot;, a daring glass Arch, standing on the Lez riverside, it is 50 meter high, the tallest building in the city center. In Montpellier you can have the opportunity to go through three different eras in less than a day!%%

      I had the opportunity to travel a lot. I keep good memories of all my travels, but Tokyo has made the upmost impression on me. This is such a giant city, so crowed, but the citizens are hugely polite. Skycrapers are erected near peaceful parks and when you are inside one, you feel like you are in a remote place and definitly not in a busy city. The food also was a real discovery for me because it was so different from what you can eat in Japanese restaurants around the world. The fish is really fresh and is prepared with as much attention as the piece of art.

      Hello everybody , my  name is Isabelle Fonquerne and I'm running for Student Council. You certainly know that our council needs strong leadership and I am ready to offer mine.Though I've always thought that everyone was responsible for their life, when I see other students experiencing daily difficulties per  lack of money, I tend to think now that I can help make the difference. If you elect me, I promise to persuade the Principal  to imagine a new way of living on our campus and adopt a more supportive and less individualistic system. With you  help, I will have the Principal  create a fund that will enable everyone to go on field trips even if they can't afford it. Then, I will make sure everyone eats at least three meals per day in the cafeteria and make my best to improve the quality of the food.I cannot encourage you enough to vote me for President. I need your support, so don't forget to go to the polls on Sunday. Together we'll be stronger!

      When you receive an invitation for a party, you must reply relatively quickly because your host can think you're waiting for a better invitation. At the party, it's thoughtful to bring a small gift , bottle of wine or flowers  to your hostess. You must be polite with the other friends and introduce yourself each other. When person are sit down,  if a woman or an elderly person come,  all the gentlemen would stand up. Don't take or receive phonecall, or send text messages with your smartphone . At dinner table, eat carefuly, slowly and  use cultery correctly .  Don't slurp ! Don't yell  or don't talk about politic, religion  or money. It&quot;s impolite to get up for going to the restroom when you are on the table. Put your napkin on your lap and don't put your elbows on the table. When you live the party,  said how happy you are and few days after send a short thank you note or email to your host.

      Dear Polaris, Thank you for asking us for advice on stopping shopping. Here is a plan that might work for you. Firstly, you have to look at your wardrobe to know if you really need some new clothes. If you don't need anything, you don't have to buy anything. Secondly, when you go to the city, don't take your bank card, but only get some money in your wallet. Finally, how about replacing shopping in the streets with walking in parks? If you stick this plan, you'll feel better and you won't have any money problem. Be confident!

The actors were good, the special effects realistic, but I think that there were too romance and too gladiator battlles, so not enough time for the volcano !

We had coffee and bread to begin, then an huge main course with baked bins, potatoes, sausages and salad and an enormous plate with at least, twenty sorts of different cheeses. For the dessert, an home made lemon tart. It was amazing ! Unfortunately, nothing was organic or locally grown but everything was delicious and very fresh. I'll definitely go again.

You love it! And there are many treatments and techniques for dealing with claustrophobia. You can try the meditation and the relaxation for exemple. It's really important to make small steps and gradually. you can talk with a psychologist. I think that will be great for you.I will bring you the leaflet next week.Have a nice week-end!Emilie

Then my professional life: I work from home and my computer is a vital element (mails, Internet). I agree, I am totally dependent. One might say that it can be overwhelming but the good think is that you still have an option and can decide to only accept some parts of technology and reject the elements you dont want.

      I think some laws about health and driving  protect us. In France it isn't possible to drink more than two glasses of wine before driving. The policeman can submit you to an alcohol test, and if the test shows that your alcohol degree is superior to the limit authorised, the policeman take of your licence, you cannot drive for a while and you pay a fine. You must also respect the speed limits which can be  different if you are driving on a little road or a big one. It's very difficult because it's seems sometimes stupid, the limits aren't justified. Nevertheless the accidents decrease regularly, that it's a good thing.

However, I happened to be present at one representation of a Puccini's opera: Mrs Butterfly. I must confess that I was a little bit reluctant, but I wanted to please my wife who is fond of operas, and I don't regret now. As soon as the drop cloth raised and the conductor began to direct the orchestra, magic overcame me. The story takes place in Japan, and the sets were so much wonderful and adapted than I felt like if I had been in Tokyo, at the former century. As for the plot, it was deeply stirring: Mrs Butterfly had been seduced by an American officer, who returned alone in his country. She has been waiting for him for three years, but, when he comes back, he has married another woman and he wants to take the child he conceived with Mrs Butterfly. Then, she commits suicide. Plus, the quality of the voices was breathtaking and Puccini's music significantly increased the strength of the emotion! In a nutshell, I discovered a masterpiece and a performing art that I am fan of now.%%

      My sister-in-law, just now, is really with money problems. She has just found a job, with not very high monthly wages. She is divorcing. Last month, she moved out, and she had to put down a 300 euros deposit, and 1 monthly rent in advance. Furthermore, her future ex-husband who is insolvent, will leave the former apartment only next month. She will thus have to pay 2 monthly rents. Not to mention the expenses of divorce, she will probably have serious difficulties to obtain a maintenance allowance for the custody of her daughter. She has just made an appointment at her banker's. I don't know why, but I can feel that my wife is going to give in to pity, and is going to ask me to transfer some euros to her younger sister's account. We bet?

I'm so optimistic regarding this idea because some people will be sensitive to the environment protection.

Every year, I needed two months, it was a dull and long work... too much... too few! We have some computer during the seventies but it were big machines, requiring air cooling rooms. On the other hand, in the eighties, everything bebame tinier and we saw the first personal computers.

It's pop music with a country influence I think. The singer has a really smooth and beautiful voice. The sound of the guitar is really present but I like it so much. When I listen to it, I can close my eyes and imagine to be in a rural landscape, with cowboys and cows in the middle of fields. The move is calm but you move your head or feet easily on the rhythm of the music. So, let's go, listen to this music.

      Office politics are something which is most of the time underestimated. Indeed, people think that they might avoid problems at work if they're keeping shut. But soon, they understand that nothing comes to you if you don't provocate it, or if you don't seemed involved in the life of your company. Office politics are actually a kind of strategy to reach out your goals or to keep/get a good place in the company. You have to understand what comes around you, and how to get into it.Try to speak with your colleagues, or your bosses. If people see you're involved and you're listening to their advices, you will be soon considerate as an important element of the company. But avoid mistakes : don't look willing to do everything you can to backstabber those who are on your way. Play clever, and find your place in that specific world. With friends, everything is easier, and in your job as well.

      My dream is to be an engineer in Australia. I conclude the last step of my engineer diploma with Englishtown formation online. However, I still have to pass one final test which is named TOEIC. After I passed this exam, I plan to develop my skills in boiler-making and industrial piping during approximately five years in a French company. In ten years' time, my first wish could be to work in a design company or a construction company in Australia. My second wish could be to develop myself and open up my own company in piping or renovation. Although I intend to be an expert in piping or in renovation, I still want to develop my skills in boiler-making.%%

      My friend told me, his company has difficulties with the staff. This company is working at the airport. Some blue-collar workers dont respect the behaviour management. Sometimes, when the manager asks them to execute a work, they dont want to do it. If the boss gives a sanction, they go on strike. Thats the big problem. There is maybe a solution: The rule must be well-defined and right written. When the company hires a new worker, she has to inform people. If any one doesnt respect the contract, he will be fired. The boss and the managers will take time to think before meeting. A report will be written to describe the rules, the tasks, and the responsibility for doing a part of work. Maybe the work will be better done.

      It not obvious to have the answer about this question: do companies have a responsibility to society? In fact I think there is no good answer, there is just many different point of views. For me it depends of how the companys activities impact the overall society. Actually every companys activities don't have the same impact on the society. Some have a very bad impact on the society like some big industries. They really heart the atmosphere and mess up the city. These kind of companies have a great responsibility to society. I think they should be obliged to give back to the society by contributing to the improvement of the environment, by helping students or by helping schools with computers and others staff. However others companys activities have any impact on the society. These companies have not a big responsibility to society, but they could act positively in society and have some good advertisements. We call it a win-win situation because everyone win, the company and the society.

      I met her while I was working as a volunteer in a social non-profit organization. She was the secretary of the leader of this association. When I saw her, I only had a look on her, but nothing more because I was fairly shy, and she was so pretty that I would have never hoped she had even remarked me. But I didn'k know that was however the case : as soon as I went out of the office, she asked her boss who I was, whether I was single or married, where I lived, etc. Her boss explained to her I was going out with a girl I wasn't in love with. So she set a meeting up, made me understand her feelings...I let you guess the following. Twenty five years later, we still are in love.

It will have about twenty job cuts for the three societies. Some people from Autun may come and work to Chalon. At Dole, it should have the highest rate of job cuts because all the analysis will leave the site. Everyone was demoralized after this update. Action item : * We have to get ready to receive all the bacteriology analysis for june. An extention of the laboratory should start as soon as possible to be ready for this date.

      The situation in France is quite similar as in Great-Britain. The WW2 enabled women to have an economic position in the French society. Moreover the action of a minister, Simone Veil, has helped women to get a more &quot;confortable&quot; way of life. Indeed her main action was to settle the abortion law in 1979. Nowadays more and more firms are inroducing new rules in term of parity. They wish to have equality among their boards which can be a proof of equity value. But gender differences such as salary difference still exist. Nevertheless women are lucky since they are living longer than men. But is that a real luck?

      Im surprised at how violent and obscene some TV shows can be these days in France. There are a lot of scenes of murder and sex. In my opinion, it is to cut down on the costs of scriptwriters. There can be more than ten murders in an episode.  Some sex scenes can last more than thirty seconds without any words, only rumbling sounds. If we have the chance to catch some dialogues, there are very poor and not even in correct French.  If people watched more educational documentaries or those funny comedies, that are sometimes more complex than they can appear at first sight, quality of the programs would increase.

      Sustainable development is a very innovative idea: it appeared in 1987 when it became obvious that there would be no more petroleum left in 2040 for children born in 2000, and no more natural gas to celebrate their retirement. Green business became an excellent business for some lobbies. Lets have a look on wind power for example.  Its main quality is that it is renewable. In the name of this superiority to fossil fuels, we are supposed to forget a few drawbacks. Is it consistent? No. Is it storable? No. Is it pleasant to live near a wind turbine?  No. Does it embellish our landscape? No. How many birds are killed thanks to these windmills? Last but not least: how much does it cost really? In France, it is very interesting to get its own windmill because EDF  is compelled to buy your electricity a good price and who pays the bill? Certainly not the wind companies which are the great winners of the operation! When I hear the nice people in their boat talking about paper towels, I am not surprised, just a little disappointed. The green  new religion has its rituals. Make small gestures and you will be saved and dont think too much on global problems of energy.%%

      I had an interesting professional life. At the beginning, when the kids were young, we lived in two different foreign countries, for a few years. I was very stressed by my job, but life was easy, there was not the slightest worry about money, and everybody was happy. But that ended a day. Back to France, I kept working in the same company, and my wife found a job. The children growed up. We had a house built. I was frequently traveling around the world, for short journeys or long stays, while my wife and children were staying at home. I missed a good part of the education of my children. All school problems, and others, were left to my wife. She was happy for me when I announced I was leaving to a far country, but she actually was sad she couldn't accompany me. One of my sons created a lot of problems, but I was not there to help. Now we are both retired. We live alone in a wonderful place. The children are far away, and we do not travel anymore. To tell the truth, our life is boring.

First point, the topic was really clear, he described the majors issues, which are the sales decreasing and the possible merger with a competitor. During the presentation, he showed pie charts and tables, especially the sales figures of our company compare with the competition. So, he could made a transition with the second point, the merger. About the conclusion, I regret that he couldn't explain more about the profits that we will expect in the futur with this merger. I think too that he would have speak a little bit louder, some people have been complained that they didn't hear all the comments. But it was a successful presentation, i hope the board executive has been convinced with the necessity of the merger.

      In the place where I live, the people are very laid back, and not really attentive at good manners. They are nice but simple people who do not pay much attention to the etiquette. They are more interested in a casual way of life than in a formal behaviour. They use their horn at all times and park their cars everywhere. They like to drink and eat with noise, and speak loudly in public. They will call you by your first name across the street. They would greet you with slaps in your back and kisses on the cheeks. That might shock some visitors. The only rules are that you cannot refuse a drink, and when invited, you should never show up without a bottle of wine.

In a first time  I felt only a pain at my arm. In  the evening at home the pain increased and the arm inflated. My parents brought me to the hospital after an exam the doctor made a plaster to block my arm because it was break. I kept it during one month but during this period it wasn't easy to write at school.

I could heard the waves, a place very welcoming.  *I've choosen for my appetizer an organic salad mixed  with fresh shrimps  and  a loaf of bread housemade. *Then a delicous main course  composed of vegetables baked grown locally with a T bones steak well done.  The dish was really tasty. I ordered sparkling mineral water and a  surprising wine, I found out that they could make it with oranges!!!!!!! * As dessert, I chose a creme brulee and finished by an espresso.  I really appreciated this moment, the service was top, so I let a good tip to the server.

      I live in a big flat in a nice city. I think I will have a good job when I will finish my studies because I think become a lawyer is interesting. However, I will not have good income at the beginning but I hope find a great job. When I think about my life, I have regrets. I've everything I need but I haven't time to go out with friends. I have no social life and sometimes, it's very complicated live with this feeling. Moreover, I have great parents and I can't visit them when I want because they live in a other city. To finish I love horses, I have two horses but I live in a city and its are near to my parents because my mother loves horse too. So, I think there is something missing in my life but now, with my studies, I can't change it. I hope when I will starting to work I could live in suburbs or country because I now it will be easier for me to take care of my horses.

      To complete my research on discrimination at work, I would like to interview people.  Questions that might be useful for m study: 1. Can you tell me about your interview ? Do you face any questions about your marital status or privacy that make you feel uncomfortable such as: do you want kids, or do you have kids and is it you that bring them up?  2. On your workplace, do you feel your job is less highlighted than your male colleagues? For example, you are less invited to meetings with clients. 3. Do you feel that your boss often asks you to stay late at work to destabilize or test you to ensure that you can manage your private life or to make you understand that your marital status is not compatible with more responsabilities in the firm? 4. Do you ever face to inappropriate remarks on your clothing or physique from male colleagues?%%

      I'm very interesting in skydiving, I have few friends who tried this experience and everytime I heard it was amazing.I think it is a thing that everyone should try once in a lifetime. I'm not a thrill-seeker but I like the sensation of the adrenaline. Everytime I go to a roller coster I'm not so confident but after I feel just free. Concerning skydiving I think before falling I will probably freak out a lot and during it is sure I will shout out . For me it's one of the most safety extreme sport I know, we don't jump through the air alone, we have an instructor who knows very well his job and it's him who has in charge of the parachute and it's a fact I don't need to worry about. I don't see myself to handle the job.

      Who knows ? Maybe someday we'll have gender equality . Next weekend we will vote for our mayors. In Paris, the two main candidates for mayor are women. That will be the first time that we will have a woman as a mayor. Last year the parlament voted a law to improve equality in politics. Women must be represented. Perhaps, was it the first step to achieve this equality. In many companies, men still earn ten percent more than women. Shouldn't women get equal pay for equal work? I am working as a teacher in a primary school and there are not so many men with this position. There should have been more men as teachers for young pupils. I admit that this job is not well paid, but it would be good for our pupils.

      I admire people who are professionally successful and particularily people who start from scratch. I admire entrepreneurs. For instance, one of my friends' brother has recently started a new business. This is a new concept to buy fresh fruits and vegetables. At the beginning, he had to find farmers with fresh products and negociate with them. After that he had to find a shop for rent in a rich suburb of Paris. During the first months, he worked alone so he had to supply the shop every two hours with fresh products from 8 am to 10 pm. He has not been paid for more than 6 months because he had to wait until the business was profitable. He is a very ambitious and persistent man. No matter how hard it is, he is passionate about his work. Today, he is working on the opening of his second shop in Paris. I think this start-up is going to be a real success.

      Skydiving is my favorite hobby. I took up skydiving ten years ago when one of my classmate decided to give up university to become a skydiving instructor. I went to his club and first did some training with a teacher. I liked pushing myself to the limit. I began to follow serious lessons and little by little I passed the different level exams. I do not say that it is easy to jump out of the plane and to do some free fall of one minute or even more. But it is so exciting to feel the thud of my heartbeat and finally, when you touch the land, to say &quot;I did it !&quot;. As much as you improve you overcome your fear of height and only the freedom you feel in the air remains. As like my friend did with me, I try to take some friends with me for a visit the club.

      At the beginning, IXW wanted to purchase 50 laptops PX-30 at $700 and 15 desktop computers at $1100. However the vendor wasn't agree because he sales laptops PX-30 $800 per units. The company IXW wanted this price because another company had purchase these laptops at $700. Apparently, it was a misunderstanding because the vendor didn't sold at another company laptops at $700 instead of $800. So as IXW couldn't pay for this price, the vendor suggested to IXW to take a lower laptop than the PX-30. He suggested to take the PX-29 at $690 with less memory and with a smaller hard disk than the PX-30 but he got great feedbacks about this model. Finaly, IXW accepted his offer.

      In my opinion, waching TV become less and less interesting because they always show the same programs, reality shows are boring. Besides, the kind of program you may be able to watch will depend on the time you decide to turn the tv on. Indeed, at about 12pm until 14pm, programs are educationals with the news, games which require general culture. However, from 10pm to midnight, movies are violents because we can see blood, sexual scenes etc.. I feel stongly that we should spend less time on TV and read more books.

      I think that Shawshank Redemption is the last movie that I have watched and enjoyed.The nature of history of the movie was very original combining a sense of injustice and a great plan of escape. This movie try to show us how someone can be victim of injustice and can succeed despite of very bad conditions in prison life. But the important thing that this movie reveals, in my opinion, is the possibility for justice to make a great errors of judgments and how it can destroys sometimes the life of someone who is not guilty. This movie was also a big success because the actors were really fantastic and had played their role perfectly .

      In France, the trend is not to give tests to student more often along the year. In the end of the year, students have an exam.I'm against exam when a serious student fail the grade.For me, I prefer tests more often in the year because if a student fail one test he can have a better note an other test. In France , it is anusual to see older people in a college. But an old person can pass an exam in the end of the year. I think it is a good thing.

      My favorite game is a card game but a little bit special. There is a game master who organized the game. The rules are easy, there are the villagers and the werewolves, each players take a characters and try to kill all the werewolves and all the villagers. The game starts and all the players have to close eyes, it''s night and the game master calls the werewolves who are allowed to open the eyes and allowed to designate a player who will be kill. The newt day, all the players have to open the eyes and the game master show one player who was killed by the werewolves. The players have to discuss and kill an other player. The villagers and the werewolves have not the same interest and there are a lot of bluff. I love this game.

      Hi Ian, l heard about your decision to quit the job and your claustrophobia. I understand your choice and i know how painful it can be to be anxious or sweating or having a panic attack in the middle of the crowd. However i wanted to let you know that there is some solutions to ease your pain and i would encourage you try them out before you resign from your current job. have you ever heard of cognitive behavioral therapy ? Most of the patient completely overcome their fear using this technique. Basically, a therapist will teach you how to manage your own fear by adopting a positive mind attitude. Still, a little training in meditation and relaxation can be really liberating. In the very worst case, drug treatments can help you. Please, consider trying those solutions, i'd really like you to overcome this problem in a definitive way. cheers

      Last year, I attended a presentation about a price of youth literature organized by various partners of the city. The opening of the presenter, who was in charge of the culture at the municipal library, was clear. At first he explained to the audience the main objectives of this event. I have to admire his excellent speaking ability when he reminded us how an important mediation was a necessity to win the interest of children. Then if he hadn't spent 30 minutes talking about the budget, the presentation wouldn't have been so boring. I'd  have liked more details about the schedule and the rules we have to respect. Fortunately he handed over to other partners and to the booksellers of the city who were very precise about on the choices that we could buy: only fiction books published less than 3 years ago. They finished by describing the conditions of making a shop window for each bookshop. Finally there was no time any more for questions so the presenter gave us the address of a website where we could find a summary of each key points.

Chief executive: The primary problem is the merger of course. This aim point will determine I we replace some elements from our company! Sara: Ok, I think the merger is a good solution. The last figures are bad, our sales are more and more low and our sales strategy is less and less accuratecause the global crisis. Paulo: I was not aware how serious the situation was! Could you be more specific? Sara: The best example I can give is the decreasing market share. Paulo: AhI understand now the competitors proposition. We give them our better brain and they improve our sales that is to say our company. John: Its true, our team building is perfect. And the only way to solve sales problem might be to increase the training budget. Chief executive: And they can bring this training moneyMoving on, lets discuss the replacement. Sara: I think this team is solid and we and them could give the best together. Chief executive: Yes, its the reason why I suggested that you take the job as chief executive here in France.%% I know you wont be destabilized under pressure and everybody here trust in you. Paulo: I think so tooCongratulations on your promotion!!! Sara: Thanks, but no need to congratulate me. John: And what about you?

First you were a champion in swimming. Don't forget you could come back to the swimming pool. Take more exercice, it's a good method of removing your stress. I enjoy me to come with you and if you want we could eat together. Secondly you must be positive, try not to worry about things you can't control. This is not effective. A job is not the most important thing of world. Thirdly think about your healthy. You must sleep well and eat at regular hour, don't smoke and drink excessively. Remember your last problem with alcohol. You lost your job but it's could be a second chance to restart a new life. It would ve pleasure to me to see you again With all my friendship Arthur

According to these requirements , only the villa and business for ' 450000 would be available because it gives all the responses to the Blight family exigences . The Cottage offers only one bedroom and it couldn't be the solution .The Hamilton house is too big for the family .The new appartments doesn't offer the necessary bedrooms for the Blight family .

So, it's very simple to answer to these question. Indeed, I am a young women, I'm only 17 years old and I go to school every day. So, I don't have enough time to go on a real school. Moreover, study online is most cheaper way that I found to study and the advantage is that I can learn when I want, where I want and how I want. I'd like to study english. In fact, I have to progress in english. At the end of the year, I'm going to have a big exam. The most important exam in my live. It will determinate what I'm going to be. However, I don't have a very good english so I have to work hard to advanced. I hope to make some progress with an online study program. I am very independent and organized so it won't be difficult for me to study with an online program. Sincerely, Filali Dina

      The man was retired from business. He had worked a lot, and had been benefiting from his huge fortune. He said he traveled a lot all over the world, and he was often seen playing at the casino. His house built on the western coast was luxurious, even opulent to excess and of bad taste. One supposed that an elederly oil tycooon should have so much money that he could make people envious. When one day he had been found in his swimming pool, a jewel-encrusted dagger set in his heart, no one has been really surprised. Paintings had disappeared, but the robbers seemed to have looked for a long time for money, considering the disorder into the house. Later, the police showed the paintings were imitations. In fact, the man was broken. Only the jewel encrusted in the dagger was authentic. And the robbers had forgotten it.

      The earth is dirty, people don't see that ! Air and water quality becomes increasingly bad. Unless the spirits change, pollution will persist. But i'm optimistic, mentality start changed and with downtime we'll be able to improve our quality of life and our environment !

      I graduated in law and political science from the University of Paris Assas and IEP. Prior to start working, I have had to do my military service as a naval officer. What a great experience ! I learned the way of managing a staff and building team spirit. Moreover , I had the opportunity to visit lots of country overseas. When I got back to Paris, I was offered an internship in a middle sized law firm which I knew before.Things went very well. I became an associate, afterwards a partner. Eight years later , I headed the public law department . I was passionate about my job. But at that time, I was elected as the mayor of our small town in the country where we have our family property. Subsequently, I have had to spend much time overthere, too much time from my partner's perspective. They would have prefered that my main worry be making money than working for common interest. The mood was awful at work. Then I decided to start my own business. Now, with a small team of only seven layers, I run a small law office in charge of public law and local autorities regulation.%% Although I earn less money , I'm frankly very glad because I have much more time to deal with the issues that my town faces. And I'm sure that as soon as economy will turn around, the market of our small practice will dramatically pick-up in order to achieve the building of a french cutting edge public law company.

      The last time I have been at a restaurant, it was with members of my family. We are used to go to these restaurant, I think we have already tested all the dishes. This last time was a special day because we were celebrating the birthday of my uncle. He invited us, that also means he paid. For that reason I took sausage with a baked potatoe. The others commanded red meat or confit od duck with french fries. Of couse we drank red wine, a bourgogne. As a dessert I ate a cheese strainer with a red berries coulis. It was pretty good but I think a confit of duck would have been better.

      The first object who affected my life it's a video game console. it brought me a subject other than the football. Then the mobile came with an internet connection which we give access to the news around the clock. More the social network and the MMORPG arrived and expanded.They put people closer virtually, it was the first revolution. The second revolution arrived with the tablets, their large screen, their thinness and their ease of transportation. There also arrived of the free hand by the voice. But all of this is very expensive. Maybe a lighter revolution will make decrease the prices.  I'm very enthusiast about the next revolution.

      Hi John You intend studying in France and ask me for explanations on the French educational system. The subject is vast and difficult to explain in a e-mail. If you are a holder of a high school diploma in your country, you can start studies in France. You have to make recognize your diploma and master the French language at a level adapted to the formation. You can register directly to the university for long studies in numerous domains. Nevertheless, be careful: the university does not select the students. There is a high rate of failure at the end of the first year. I'll be glad to provide you with further details.

      The usability is much better on nileretail.com than on the-shopping-space.com. On the latter one, the user has to scroll through all the screen to see what products are being sold, which is not the case on  the first one. Indeed, the designers who have worked on nileretail have a better understanding of customer needs, whereas the-shopping-space completely misses the point. While the-shopping-space doesn't make the products easy to find and to purchase, nileretail does even better than that, making the user feel very comfortable while browsing through the website. The 'search inside the book' feature for instance is a success because it is designed to help the user in his research. The user will be much more inclined to buy on nileretail than on the-shopping-space, which is the aim of both websites though.The designers who have worked on nileretail did well and delivered a user-friendly website. On the contrary, the people who have worked on the-shopping-space should have all these major issues in mind and improve the website fast if they don't want to lose their clients.

Exacly, from St Petersbourg. The performance was one of a kind because the musicians used tradtional musical instruments from Russia, like balalaka and some others I don't even know the name. There is nothing like the rythme of these old songs from this country! Costumes also, were exquisite. In addition, what made this concert unique were the voices of two young women which were really wonderful. The place where the concert was sitting, is a little far from everywhere: A huge auditorium in the moutain! But, never mind. It well worth the money!

      I wish to brainstorm about management strategies. I have some suggestions to do : -First, to do a good job, I think employees should trust managers and out's the same for the contrary. It's the only way to have an efficient team with good team players. You should give more responsibilities to your employees, regarding to their skills, so that you'll keep time to work about new projects, expansion -Second, you should keep confidence of the clients and maintain good relationships. I suggest to invite them for lunch sometimes or take time to call them to have news, information, even if you are not actually in business with them It's very important for the qualities of the negotiations, you could have later. -Third, I think everyone is too often disturbing in his work by colleagues, telephone, meetings I suggest one day per week without conference call or meeting so that we can focus on our own work and respect our deadlines. -Endly, I believe that with the expansion of the company and the new recruitments, we are now to many in our office. So, I'm looking for new spaces ; and I suggest to do a meeting as soon as I have received some proposal.%% I wish to make with you the final decision : where, when and how proceed for the relocation  I remain you that I'm always curious to hear your new suggestions, ideas and comments. I'm waiting for your answer and encourage you to continue your good job.

      Dear Shelley, This is very curious, when you wrote me the e-mail, I happen to be very close to the store, and I received it on my phone, I thought this was an interesting coincidence so I decided to buy it right away. Can't you believe that?, I never go to that place, not even close and you asked me to go there just in the moment when I am there, by chance. I entered into the shop and there it was, a sand painting with a C-shaped design and a person with a square face inside. I am quite sure that I picked the right one, because the person holds both arms up towards the sky, with a long, narrow, rectangular body and wearing a skirt with an oval on it; just like you asked me to. The only way I was wrong is that they had the same with different colors, I took one with Reds, yellows and browns. Anyway I'am sending you the one I bought, I hope you enjoy it, and don't worry about me helping you with your desire; next time you buy me something; you know I love these sort of things Best regards, Carlos

      I think I will retire when I'm 60. At that age, one is still healthy and young, and one can still enjoy their life. Of course, my wife and I will leave the subburbs and sell our house. No way that we would retire close to our working place. Straight down to the sun. Since we had four children, we had a large house, near Paris. With the sale of that house, we could easily buy a nice cottage in Provence, between the mountain and the sea. When we made our honeymoon trip there, 35 years ago, we said &quot;this is the place we will retire in&quot;. But of course, at that time, we were not seriously thinking of our retirement. But now sure we do !

      In 1999, the day after Christmas, there was a big storm in my country. The wind blew at more than 150 km/h. The trees were uprooted, falling over each other, due to both waterlogged ground and strong wind. Lots af cars and roofs were damaged by those falling trees. The large pine forests were totally destroyed in Lorraine and in Alsace and a significant amount of wood was lost for building consumption, whereas the firewood reserve rised. The landscapes were desolate and people feel really shook up. During several days, sometimes more than a week, homes were without electricity, that is to say without heating and lighting in the winter. Roads were cut by fallen trees and people weren't able to join their home after Christmas Eve. It was a nightmare.

She was alone in a road in the countryside when I passed by and I didn't stop until I drove about 200 metres, I returned. The car was having smoke over the hood and she couldn't manage to open it while she was soaked. I suggested her tow it to the nearest garage. The day after, she called me to say thank you and I asked her out. Our first date was restaurant and movie. Everything was fine and we could get along with each other. We seemed to love each other and it's true. I asked her to marry me 3 months later. We have a lovely kid now.

      Hi Anna!I've found an absolutely amazing job for you. Let me tell you why you should apply. This position as a zookeeper sounds amazing, it's by far the best you could come up with: you will have the opportunity to work outside, with animals. Isn't that what you've been craving for? I'm positive that you will find this exhilarating. It might also be a quite dangerous job, they say you'll have a full accident insurance, but as you like pushing yourself to the limits, I guess that's no problem to you. You'll just have to be careful when you're dealing with the animals. They also offer one month holiday a year, an even trips to observe wild crocodiles in Florida. I urge you to consider this offer, and please apply for it quickly, as I'm sure it is a popular one.See you soon!

      Is gender equaity still a big problem in France ? Today, many women in France are working at top positions. We can find a difference in the position taken by women and men.

For example, robots could help elderly for daily activities in the way that they could live longer in their home.

Some people are more pessimistic: they think that robots wil take over our lives, and there will be fewer jobs and more unemployement.

      I think it's necessary to better understand the needs of the students in France. In fact, for the counseling it's very difficult to make the good choices during the high school or sometimes before. The system of counseling don't listen enough the students, and the needs of the market. It's not unusual to see students make a mistake in the studies. Anybody listen to the students during my study to figure out who I was or what I wanted, but I think to pass my life and my project I liked that. After my degree, my goals change and in my country it's possible to go back to school and to make a internship. I'm in favor of them, it's very good to start a new career. In France, the new technology appear in the school and the flexibility too, but it's difficult with the mind and the education. In my business school, it's mandatory to have a computer to make a study. The trend is to give tests to students all the time, to see the level and to obtain a notation. But I think it's not a good way to learn.%% It's not good for the confidence and it encourage to fail.

      I can talk about several laws and rules in my country. First of all, death penalty is not used for verdict for a crime. Personally, in certain cases we could apply this sentence, because of the horrible situation of the felony. On the other hand, for some people it's just another inhuman way to convict someone. Regarding on another law, which states that is not permitted to smoke in public places, according to me it is a good law. I don't smoke, but I used to, and by the years I was a smoker I always have respected the non-smokers people. That's why I have always smoked outside. Even if it is an addiction, that law permits to respect the health of people who don't smoke, and also I just see that. To finish with the subject of the guns, in France it is not allowed to buy a gun if you don't have the licence to use a weapon. In my view, I am totally terrified of the guns, then I am very happy that law takes place in our Constitution.

      Action film is a kind of movie what I prefer to watch. Yesterday, I saw a film &quot;Fast and Furious 6&quot;. What's an amazing action movie! This film was directed by Justin Lin who is a producer very famous of series &quot;Fast and Furious&quot;. Movie's characters were played by the famous actors: Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson or Paul Walker. The story of action film has nothing to say. By the way there is always a good against evil with the characters; good boys vs bad boys.

      Some fathers spend all their time in their work. At every time they can explain that they have good reasons to work more and more: to earn enough money  to offer the best college, the best clothes, the best activities to their children. They think that they are good father but it is not right. Children need their parents to grow up. As a father I learned that you are responsible of the education of your children. It is not the job of school it is yours. You have to spend time with them even if you are tired and you just want to sit on your sofa and watch TV. You have to play with them, you have to explain them what is important. To be present is the key. Your task is to show them how to be dynamic, open-minded, polyvalent and responsible.

      Since our meeting I've heard your request and after having search some informations about the different renewable energies, I've made my mind and today I can present you two kinds of renewable energies that could correspond with the expectations of our town and I'm going to explain you why .Living in an area where we have sunhine all year round, my first choice would be that one installs solar panels on the rooftop of all the residences  like that residents can use solar energy as well as for both the heating of their home than for that of water. they could by the same, use also this energy for their kitchen appliances, such as blenders, microwave ovens and electric grills. They can so save a lot of energy and above all money.They could also resell the surplus of energy to a company of electricity that will yield them a gain of money and by the same allow them to amortize the expenses they have made.The city being by the sea, and as we have 365 windy days a year, My second choice would be that of wind power which is more economical due to the fact that it necessites negligible fuel costs and relatively low maintenance costs.That's now up to you to decide if wether or not the latter is better suited to our town than the former or vice versa .

      In my country , we habe vere strict laws about driving and drinking alcohol.  I think sometimes the laws are so strick because when you drink just 2 glasses of wine.You can't drive because you are against the law. If you are catched by the police , you will lose some points on your driving licence and probably pay an expensive fine. A friend of mine , has been catched one time by the police. She had just out the nightclub when she was driving. The police stopped the car and took the licence driver of my friend and she loose it.

      Dear Teacher, I'm 45 years old and the technology has changed my life these last five years. Before, I was overwhelmed by the improvement of the technology. As an Engineer, I must be more productive and not engrossed by the evolution of the technology. My laptop and my smartphone with a wifi connexion have stimulated my day-to-day work. If I want to know something, an internet connexion provides me all the data I need. Internet is a revolutionary improvement for most of us who used to have the knowledge by reading books. My smartphone is also a marvelous product. I can phone all over my country. This smartphone can also be transformed to a GPS or a computer with an internet access... My HD TV is a significative evolution of the technology. This high quality of the screen and the possibility to have severals hundred of channels has changed my vision of the world. The objectivity of the media has been improved by this diversity of channels (instead of six channels before). It's also possible to watch a DVD at home by using your internet provider subscription without leaving your house. In my point of view, a touchpad seems to be useless and too much expensive for my need.%% Best regards Serge Blanc

You must be more careful with your time management, youre in late for several appointments . Then you must be more tidy, you have obligations to live with your coworkers. After that, you should help in the technical problems and you should update the database, its your responsability. You should be professional and thus everything will be for the best.

      'Rick Dangerous' is a video game I played when I was young. The main character is looking like Indiana Jones. At the beginning, a rolling stone runs to crush him. You have to avoid every trap in hundred labyrinths. Sometimes, you have to shoot evil Indians or they kill you if touched. Sometimes, you have to avoid arrows thrown from some walls or statues by crouching down or jumping. You also can use bombs to explode rocks that block the way, but you have to be careful not to be too close or you die.It's a really funny game!

      In France, children can go to school when they are 3 years old. I think it's important for us to go at school early because they learn to live with other children. Then elementary school is very quite important because children begin to learn reading and writing. In the middle school, children can be mixed with bad students and unfortunatly, the teacher cares about students with problems : Good students have to wait for them. It's a waste of time for the last one. That's why if I had a child, he would go on a private elementary and middle school.

      There are a lot of beautiful places to visit in France.  There are a lot of plains and mountains, a lot of forests and a lot of beaches on the coasts, too. I recommend that you plan your trip in the beginning of the summer, on May or June. The weather will be sunny and prices will be less expensive than on July or August.  I suggest first hiking in the mountains to see the glaciers and admire streams running through beautiful flowers. After that, I suggest travelling to the ocean and getting relaxed on a beach.

      One of my all time favorite movies is Sleepy Hollow. Sleepy Hollow is a 1999 American-German horror film directed by Tim Burton. It is a film adaptation loosely inspired by the 1820 short story &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot; by Washington Irving and stars Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci. The plot follows police constable Ichabod Crane (Depp) sent from New York City to investigate a series of murders in the village of Sleepy Hollow by a mysterious Headless Horseman. In my opinion, that movie has the most incredible plot, I have ever seen. The acting was great. There is no dull time.

      Having a model or an ideal is very important to be guided in life towards the path of sucess. If  we do not have necesserly a person we admire, we have at least an idea about it. Let me give you some insights about my personal idea of a successful person. To me sucess is not all about money. Actually, it is not at all a money matter. Somebody is not sucessful because he is rich but he is rich because he is sucessful. Indeed, I will define the fact of being successful as being able to overcome difficulties and failures to finally achieve to master a specific topic and being acknowledged  by others for that. In fact,there are different manners of sucess. We can be sucessful in business by achieving a great career or being an entrepreneur with a fast-growing company. But we can also be seen as a sucessful person if we have  life-enhancing hobbies or an acknowledged mastery of a musical instrument. To concIude, I want to underline the fact that I admire people who can go further than everyone else in their specific domain. Whatever the domain is, Business or academic knowledge.

Then, in the future we will also use more green innovation like solar panel or we will use electric cars and all of that will decrease the polllution. But in the other and, I'm pessemistic, I'm scared about the future ; what will become the human ? the robots will not invade us ? human will not be dehumanized ? Will kept our values, our know-how ?

      Dear Polaris,Firstly, you should agree to let a friend watch your money. Why don't you go shopping with a trusted friend?Secondly, you have to pay for purchases in cash. If you take your master card, you'll attempt to spend more.Finally, you have to find new activities other than shopping. How about doing some sports?

      In my opinion, TV is too violent these days, For example, each evening, you can see one or more movie with ony violence or sex. I feel strongly that TV should be more educational, Documentaries are the best way to get an education from TV. For example, you can learn about space, you can see countries that you never visited. With Cable channels, it's easier to have educational channel, and you can visit the world from your home. However you canhave a help with the rating system, and if you have young children, it's not a too bad system.

      I just listened to the song 'Home Improvement' by Josh Woodward and I can say that I had quite a nice time . In my opinion, the beat of this song is rather dynamic and catchy but the whole song is very repetitive, very long too , and becomes  a little annoying ! So , I don' t like it very much . I am not keen on Josh ' voice because what he lacks is range and perharps vocal method when he hits a few  high notes . But even if I am admitting that the mood that is given by the song stays rather pretty , I am not  convinced neither by this singer  nor by the  melody which are not very original . Other people have done it. What a pity !

First the vessel wasn't new and it wasn't a cruise ship. In fact, it was a horrible and a shabby little boat. For example the ship had many problems with its engine during the trip. Our vessel was very dangerous! Then, the cabin was dirty and full of ants; beds were uncomfortable; bathrooms were dirty and disgusting. Next our captain was unfriendly and unprofessional; he woke up late. Yes I know, its difficult to see wild animal but we see only type of the animals they were promised In the end, there were extra, hidden charges.

      I don't like baseball, but 'Moneyball' was a very interesting movie. The story is a little dark. You learn some dreadful things about sports, but 'Moneyball' has a happy ending. 'Moneyball' is about the Oakland A's general manager, the famous Billy Beane. Beane wasn't given much money. He had to get creative. Billy Beane was played by Brad Pitt, and 'Moneyball' was directed by Bennett Miller. I think that actors always do a good job when they work with Bennett Miller.

      The first main item on the agenda was the merger with Sunset. This option raised several issues, like their problems of communication and of respect of the deadlines. Solutions were found for both. Regarding to the lack of communication an incentive week-end will increased both team-building and their ability to communicate. As for the second issue, the CFO proposed to reward employees with days-off when they achieve to respect the dead-line of a fat file. Those two proposition sould also improve employee's morale, compensating with the rising freeze. Regarding the merger, the CFO thought the two compagnies wouldn't match because of thecritical financial situation of Sunset, so he called off the merger. Otherwise, the decision of replacing the CEO has been delayed and another meeting has been scheduled.

      I think there are three possibilities : Firstly, Gavin Taylor has cheated on Alana . It's possible because many stars hit on others stars. Everyday we hear gossips about celebrities, everyday we hear a wedding and a divorce. I call that &quot;The celebrity life&quot; Next, Alana, want only money and she has prepared a conspiracy to have a part of his fortune. Finally, I think it's a conspiracy of media because they lie about all, they want, they need bad news to do a good audience in a TV show or to sell more newspaper. Marlyse

      I think that our life is so short to wast it beeing depressed or catching for money. My theory of happiness is to love life and to maximize it with my family, my lovely husband. I have another secret of life, it is - never stop to dream, when I have one dream come true, I hurry to have another new one! I think it stimulates to have a sunny smileto be in a good mood every morning,  and to appreciate what you have. Before, I was often depressed for any failure, considering to be the most unlucky person. But I was wrong, because, more I was depressed, less I had any changes and improvement. So I decided to not be depressed anymore, and drive away any negative ideas. Life is a mirror, smile to it to have the reflection.

      As a ground staff at airport, I have a meeting before every flight I work on. At the beginning the supervisor told us how many passengers to board on a specific flight, he also prevented us if there will be some passengers who need help such as unacompanied minors, people on wheelchair. Then the supervisor decided who goes to check passengers, who goes to the boarding and who goes to carry on the unacompanied minors and people on wheelchair. He made us a schedule with the timetable to be at the check in, boarding and the hour which the plan has to fly off. At the end he asked us if we have some questions about the flight and if not and if we have time before to check passengers we can look on the departure control system (software for the check in and the boarding).

Also, it's dangerouse of to go out alone at night. Lastly, never smoke anywhere It's against the law. If you go to visite someone, you should always bring a smallgift and if going through a door you should let ladies go first. Mustapha.

      Hi Jamy! I hope you're fine. I know you want to move in France. Do you have any goals? What do you want to do? There are a lot of good universities and school not expensives. You can have interships and you can take night courses. If you havent time you can online study. There are great live classes. The instructors are very qualified. One advantage is that you can study whenever you want and whatever you want. One disadvantage is that the live classes are more expensive. But you can work if you need money because you will have a flexible schedule. This is another advantage. In france, the trend is that students are buying electronic books, or e-books. I totally support the use of e-readers. I look forward to see you. See you later Jenny

      A few year ago I attended a presentation concerning post traumatic syndrome after a war. The opening was compelling. One thing the presenter did well was explaining a lot of psychiatric definitions with examples or clinical cases. He was patient and allowed people to ask questions for better understanding. I really admire the way he presented keys issues. Although there were visual aid the speaker was so brillant that I didn't care about. The charts were too complicated to the audience . There were a lot of questions asked to the presenter so he didn't finish on time . I think the presentation would be better, if the presenter had gave support paper to the audience allowing them to check definition and specific terms before asking question. Overall , the presentation was very interresting and well done. Me and the audience learned a lot.

      Who could say why there are still so many gender differences in France in 2013? The most visible gender difference is still at work. Most women work today but is is still difficult for them to reach the same level in the hierarchy and to have the same salary for an equal job. Mentality has changed of course. But most women have to take care of their children and it is not easy for them to invest themselves at work as much as men. Nowadays, women have more freedom but as a consequency, there are more and more women who are raising their children alone and are more prone to insecurity. However, which women would like to go back in the 1990s? Today, there are gender equality in the studies and women have much more opportunities than before. Gender differences are decreasing but there are still much room for improvements.

How afraid you may have been !I 'd like to tell you something more funny that happened to my husband and I, many years ago when we were visiting Norway.We had rented a little chalet in a very beautiful place and were spending nicely our holidays. One day, as we were cooking in the little chalet, suddenly the electricity went off and we found no way to make it start again. So we went out, to the house of our housekeeper not far away obviously. When we arrived, I tried to explain in english what was happening and I said : Plums (meaning &quot;les plombs&quot; in french) are off in our chalet.She looked at us and said : &quot;plums&quot; oh OK, no problem. She got round her house, took a little stepladder and told us to follow her. So we had a walk for about 10 minutes. We arrived into a field, she found a tree, put the ladder below and show us out to collect plums that were on it. Obviously, my husband and I did laugh a lot about this adventure.To the teacher : I did't receive the last correction of my exercise Unit 3. Thank you very much if you can send it back to me. Dominique

      Dear Audrey, I have my master degree but I really don't know what I want to do. I try to improve my english level because I hope to work in different country around the world. I'd like to earn a lot of money in order to don't have obstacle. I want to see the world, we have only one life so it'd be so sad if we don't enjoy it. What do you think about that ? But I know that is an idealistic thinking. We live in a strange world, no one know what the future will be. Best regards. Laurent

      In my country, we have very strict laws about driving and drinking alcohol. I think theblaws are so strict because, in the past, there were many terrible accidents caused by drinking and driving. The first time the police catch you drinking and driving, youblose your license. You can also go to jail. A friend ofnmine lost his license, and he's really angry because it's difficult for him to get to work.

What should an employer do if a worker is discriminated against in the workplace because of her sex, marital status or gender? What is the pupose of Equal Pay Act? When does it apply? Can we say that all disadvantages relating to sex in the workplace constitute discrimination? What is a sexual harassment in the workplace? Give some examples. How an amployer should deal with it?

      Hi, Anna! I've found an absolutely amazing job for you. Let me tell you why you should apply to this job. First of all this is by far the most suitable job for you that I've seen. The Flossington Zoo is looking for a zookeeper. You will be in charge of preparing food for the animals and feeding them. I really urge you to apply because one of the most exhilarating benefit about this job is that you will have to do regular trips to Florida to observe wild crocodiles. The pay amount is $50,000 which is absolutely brilliant. I encourage you to send them your application as soon as possible because this job totally suits your requests. See you soon

      Dear friend, When you are in Canada, you shouldn't yell in the street. You shouldn't stay alone in a big city at night. It's dangerous. You mustn't smoke in any public building, or restaurants and public transportation. At the restaurant you shouldn't yel, or talking loudly and talking phone. It's very impolite. If you come with children , you should control him. When going through a door with other friends, you should always let ladies go first. It's very important. Bye see you soon.

      Dear Paula,Congratulations on your new job. Despite  it pays you less money, it will give you a good experience for the future. Let me make some suggestions to help you to manage to keep within your budget, especially on food. Keep your double latte coffee in the morning. It's expensive but it's important to begin nicely your day . For lunch, you might enjoy going in a inexpensive Student Cafe which is near to your office and having a range of delicious snacks and healthy salads. After work, I can understand you enjoy being with friends but  no need to go to the best restaurants to have fun. I suggest that you go to a pizza place which is cheap and friendly as well. And Why not try a sushi place where you can share different kinds of sushi and have a great time? Chinese restaurants can also offer you a delicious Peking duck  more exotic than an expensive steack with a creamy sauce. And Sometimes, just make a great cheese omelette party at home with all your friends!

      I admire brave people. For me, courage is as far the best human quality, beause it gives you all the others one to be successful. Having courage to be persistent in any tough situations. Having courage to bounce back when jalous people have tried to put down. Having courage to challenge yourself, to see your own strenghts and weaknesses and work on them. Having courage to be proactive. Having courage to innovate. Being successful is not easy. So, it's not with an easy way that we can acheive success. We cannot be successful alone. All success are within community. And this is that community which decides if you are or not successful. So, we need communicate with an effective way and being a good listener and overall an excellent team player. Having all those qualities comes with passion. A real passion, and a good confidence in what you are and what you want to do in your life could be a good driver.

      At the beginning of my professional life, I was strapped for cash as I lived in Paris where the cost of living isn't cheap. Fortunately, I had a roof over my head and food on the table. However, things were looking up as I managed to get by thanks to hard work. Indeed, I worked for more eleven years in the same company and I had been promoted. Consequently, my salary increased and I succeeded in saving money. More than two years ago, I decided to leave Paris and my work to move to Grenoble in the French Alps to live with my boyfriend. At present, I pick up part-time work but in spite of the increase of the cost of living in France, our source of income allows us to save money. Even if we are in a good shape, we need to be thrifty.

      I want to study online because I have a job and I'm too busy to go in a classroom. I think online courses are better suitable to my diary. Then I think I'm disciplined enough to study online. I'm able to impose myself to study everyday, even if I'm tired or have some other things to do. Studying must be a daily duty.I'd like study English now, and later chinese language. With this online study program, I want to change my job or develop another way to do my job, with more contacts with people from different countries and more travels to those countries. But it's not the only goal. I consider that speaking another language, especially English, is an access to other cultures and it's a mean to open my mind and have a better comprehension of the world and people around the world. So, with an online study program I hope to improve my ability to communicate with other people from different language and to open my mind.

      I remember when I growing up, I liked reading anything : newspaper; novels; travel magazines; and my favorite, historical fiction. At the time, books was printed exclusively on paper. So, it was necessary to move in library or bookshop in order to procure things to read. What the pride I felt at having on my shelves all the books I'd read. In the past, every day, all the membres of my family watched black and white TV together. We couldn't choose our program because there was a single channel. One day in the 1985s, my parents decided to buy a color TV. What delight to have this modern device. In the same time, I was pretty sad to give up our old TV. Somewhere along the way, Internet became more and more an important communication media. So, I've started to read news online with my laptop. Now, thanks to my Kindle, I can read absolutely anything I like into it. In my opinion, this new technology make reading even more relaxing. In conclusion, an e-reader is important to me for one reason: I can carry lots of books on one small device. Unlike digital media, a large space is required with paper media.%%

      I think that if we want to improve our skills in languages ,we must have a different vocabulary strategies .Because it can help us to master our speaking and our listening in order to practice this language in best conditions . In my case , one of these methods was consisting to read a lot . I always had liked to read but reading had significantly improved my vocabulary .Another method was consisting for me to take the meaning from the context . It helped me to improve my vocabulary . I also remembered playing some games like SCRABBLE wisch allowed me to memorise a lot of words .Telling a story repetitively was also a good strategy wisch I was accustomed to use .

      When I was living in Reunion island, there was an awful hurricane. I don't forget it. Actually, an enormous hurricane was announced on the radio for 5 days. So, we had been preparing a lot of things such as water, food... When the hurrican arrived, there was a lot of wind. It was very violent. Many cars and trees were destroyed in this storm. Unfortunatelly, several people were caught by the flood. Some of this people were injured but other were killed. Nowadays, some new laws have been written by several safety expert to avoid the dead next time. Sometimes, I dream about this misfortune.

By chance, several months later I met her in a party and I don't know why ... we began to speak eachother and we spoke all the night.

      Looking to the future I could be a manager. That's why I need to learn right now how to be a good leader. In my opinion I think that to be a good leader you have to be empathetic. It's important to be able to understand your employee's feelings. If they are in a good mood, if they share your vision. It's very important if you want them to achieve your goals. And it can be very useful to defuse conflicts. An excellent people skills is also necessary for being a good leader. For instance you should be able to set some activities for improving team building. By the same time, you will be able to know better your staff and to infer their best qualities and skills. You can also to be charismatic but it's not so important for me. Last but not least a leader has to be an example for his staff. You have to prove that you are competent, full of talent. If your staff admire you, they will follow you and your vision even through hardships.

      In fact, Im neither optimistic nor pessimistic about the future, Im rather very curious and a little excited, as everything could happen: the best as well as the worst. As for the best, we could imagine the end of autocratic regimes and the spread of democracy all over the world, the end of poverty, of discriminations, the development of technologies and what that means in term of improving the quality of life. As for the worst, we could feared the utilization of the nuclear weapon, the exacerbation of fundamentalism and terrorism, the utilization of technologies to spy and enslave individuals and, why not, we could imagine the seizure of the power by the robots, like in science fiction, frightening, brrrrrrrrrrrr!!! So, wait and see, and for the present, carpe diem!

      When I was ten years old, I used to go skiing downhill with my Dad, but usually, he prefered me to walk on the paths with my skis on just behind him, than we could snowplow down on very small hills. I liked best going skiing by my own, down hills, and watching the others doing, I could improve little by little more than when staying behind my father's fears. However, I had to get over my own fears. Once, after I took some training, I went down a red hill with my Dad, it was so amazing ! But while he was heading for a way to go, I went another way that was a black down hill and, my skis were going so fast as if they wanted to race on some frozen places. It was a bit terrifying because I knew I musn't do that and I could feel the thud of my beatheart for I didn't know how to stop them ! Then, I fell to the ski slope with a terrific crash : my skis were broken and my knees injuried ! I think I've alamost passed out and I was shaking in my shoes when my Dad appeared with the first aid guys !%% I regret not having following him a little more !

      French culture is very careful about manners, even if it's true that this depends on your social class too. But typically, good manners help you to keep good and longest relationships with other people. A first invitation at home is the major step to see the level of education of the people. Say hello and present rapidly oneself, express a little attention to how cute the house is for example, explain small sentences of well being.... At lunch, things can become complicated. Two hands visible on the table, napkin on the laps, fork at the left side of the plate, knife on the right side and never change the sense when eating. A glass for water, a glass for wine, change the plate for cheese and dessert... the minimum. Don't let the people alone in the room or try to invite them to do something if you have to leave the room to prepare the next plate. Typically, after an invitation you should call to your hosts to say hello, ensure everything is OK with us and thank them for the good moment spent together. And also, French people are used to 'bring back' the invitation. If not it's considered like a kind selfishness.%%

      In France where the gender equality is a real society issue,  the differences between men and women could be unseen but in the everyday life these differences are not so invisible. In fact this issue is most important in the professional life, the average wage of a woman is still lower than the average wage of a man for a same job. Moreover there are some jobs where women are in minority like in the mechanical sector however this situation could be reciprocal. In fact there are less men who work in a nursing sector. Nevertheless I'm lucky to live in a country where the issue of gender equality is more and more important and not in a country like India where the simple fact for a woman to go out in the evening is a cause of harassment.

      The graph shows national sales figures as well as the international sales figures. The graph for the national sales figures is a black line and the other one is shown as a broken line.The chronicle begins in 2004. There you can see that the broken line increases more abrupt than the black one. In 2005 it is the same, but there, you can also see that the blackline stops to increase and it begins to drop just a little bit. Right in the middle of 2005 broken line begins as well to drop, but much more than the black one before. At the end of 2005 the black graph rises very high, just until the middle of 2007. In contrast the broken graph neither drops nor rise until 2007, because then it again begins to drop hardly. At least in the middle of this last year she begins to stop, the black line just drops a little bit. To sum up the broken graph has its highest point in the middle of 2005, the other in the middle of 2007.

I often need to go to Paris for work with my team which is situated in this city. I like labor law, it's very rewarding specially when you find a good issue with employees or labor unions.

      PRODUCT WRITE-UP : by Harry The new electronic dictionary is bigger than the others. I tried it out myself and I thought it was great. But before you run out to buy one, think about the price. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw how much they were asking for it... I was rolling on the floor laughing so much it hurt ! Well, that is not exactly true, but if I were you, I'd buy the bigger version than this one; it's better value for sure. You can't deny the fact that it's the best bang for your bucks. Harry

      For the future, I am very optimistic about the technologie. Since ten years, one thousand of new technologie were created in the world. this has improved our daily of everyday as the cell phone, the computer but also the technologie for the medicine, the automobile etc. But I think that if they arrive at made robots, it is a bad thing because they would substitute the humans and we won't have work, it can be very dangerous. But the future, it also is the environment and with alls technologie the planet suffers, so the pollution increase each year. The scientific must find solution for decrease the pollution and so preserve the world.

      To start with, I'd say my life is pretty quiet. Since I finished my studies I don't have any stress. Even if I'm looking for a job at the moment, I really don't worry about my future. At the same time, I have a hectic and demanding social life! Actually, I needn't to wake up early in the morning due to the fact I'm jobless. That means, I'm able to spend more time with my friends at night. Although everyone of them think I have everything I want, I don't think so. First, I can't afford to go on holiday whereas they can. Then, I'm not very proud of myself when it comes to answering the question &quot;what's your job?&quot;. Last but not least, I became a terrible couch potato. I'm always tired although I'm used to sleep 10 hours a day. Do I like my life ? Eventually, not really. But anyway, as soon as I can't stand my lifestyle anymore, I'll do my best to make change and I'm sure I could become a workaholic.

      Actually, in my opinion there is no unique performing art in my country (France) even though some people might say cooking is one. So, I would like talking about an irish show that I saw a few month ago at Palace of Congress in Paris. I had a ticket for a place just in the middle of the first rank at two meters from the scene : I was immerged totally in that show. What I saw, what I heard was inspiring. Songs alternated with dances. Dances were so enthousiactic I would have liked to dance with the dancers. Songs in chord, in duet or by a singer alone were magical to my ears and the emotions they made me feel were so strong that, at a special moment, I really had my breath cut and, when I could breathe again, tears came to my eyes massively. I could't explain why it happened but, anyway, I was so happy !

It wasn't the first time she experienced a hurricane, but that one was the worst she had been involved with. There was no traffic, and everything was closed. The wind was seriously blowing, the shutters were banging, and the power and television were intermittent. Some people lost their houses, and unfortunately some people died. The military was called in to help the rescue workers. It was a terrible day.

      I live in France, I'm a woman and, I can see that roles males and females still are differents. The majority of women works, but, for example, they take care of the children, they clean the home, more than the mens. When the children are young, a lot of women have part-time job, or they stop working for several years. When they come back home, they also do housework, cleaning, cooking... Equality is important, because sharing of home's activities is more pleasant, let have best relationships. Also, children win a lot if their father take care of them. Yes, things are changing, but not very fast. We all have responsabilities, a lot of little actions strengthen the situation, it's hard to change the mentalities. Young generation shares more the jobs, but, unfortunatly, a lot of work stays to do.

      I'm definitely fashion addict. When I was a child, I don't like to play with dolls, but to sew clothes for them. As a teenager, I was so tall and thin that all garments were shorter and looser for me, so I decided to stop shopping and to make my own wardrobe. I am keen on several French designers, the most famous are Yves Saint Laurent and Chanel. I love their basic shapes and their harmony of colors. They are always surprising but timeless. Finally, I like to draw and sew, not really to wear what I made. I often put on black garments, which is really not in style.

      the meeting started on monday morning. There were five assistants and their chief assistant. The topic was about discharging an apprentie secretary , named Lisa, of her tasks which were now too many for her, as she obtained new charges now. The chief assistant asked her colleagues what do they think about it and how would they share those tasks nowadays. The discussion turned to a conflict because the main assistant, Evelyne, doesn't understand why Lisa had accepted first to do those tasks and argued that if she had accepted them, she has to go on with them. Lisa told that she was an apprentie and for learning her job she accepted any task she could do to fill her planning, but the goal was to learn the profession and progress were sufficient now. Lisa told that she was asked by a leader to be his own secretary and that she has no time left to fulfill all her job, so it's time to share the work among all the team. Evelyne gave her veto, and the meeting finished by the departure of Lisa, who felt herself unfairly understood, and she left the room, pouring some tears.

      I live in France and as in other countries, there is a lot to say about its quality. It's usual to complain but we must to be as objective as possible. The TV French system is not so bad than the people think, there is an assembly of independant people who check the programs and give instructions about them. No connection with the the government, no connection with political parties. So even there are silly programs as life shows where an unknown person go in front of the camera and made crazy things only to be able to chat with his colleages the day after, even if there are too much US series, one more violent than the others, we find many interesting documentaries or many programs which help people to think by their own.

      I'd rather wear something of class and sports. This is a good mix. I prefer wool to cotton especially in winter. I prefer buying expensive quality clothes more than a lot of cheap clothes. However, for my job I wear a suit with black shoes leather. I like wearing blue , withe and black more than orange , brown or purple. My grand mother has just given me a new handmade wool sweater. I love it !

      Dear M. Jones,I'm writing regarding my request to be compensated for my week-end works. Owing to an employee's absence, I have been working  last month for two entire week-end . But I have been very surprised to being refused overtime pay by my manager even  it was due to your demand. After two months, I haven't received any payment or compensation yet, which I think is not fair at all. I read over my contract which clearly states that I should be compensated in that case. This statement was confirmed by my lawyer as you can see by yourself in the enclosed document. I expect to obtain satisfaction and I hope you'll see to it by the end of the week. In case we couldn't unfortunately get an agreement, I wouldn't hesitate to go to court and ask for damages.I look forward to hearing  you soon.Yours sincerelyJohn Smith

      To the directorate.Dear,This morning I have had a disscution with Jed because he wasn't feeling weel since few months. He explained to me that him and his team feel bad about the work. Indeed, actually, there is a bad ambiance, the team feels understaffed, overworked and underappreciated. It's unacceptable to treat people like that and we need to move on. We must find an issues  as: offer some incentives, re-motivate the team, offer  overtime and bonuses, recruit people... We need to have a serious meeting about this before that the situation deteriotes totally  the team. You know it's very important to work in a good atmosphere and with a good team, make pressure on people is not the solution. Because if we continue by this way, they will stop to work and we will loose time, money and a great team. Then, they work very well together and quickly, but they are not machines.Please, let me know about a day of a meeting,Best regards,Pnlope.

      Sir, I would like to study online for many reasons. I worked since 15 years in my Society. I thought it's good for me to returned in an university to learn about the new technics in mathematics. The school requires besides the classic education to have a good level in English. To be precise I need a level of 800 points for Toeic. So, I decided to learn English by means of internet. I find this very practical means. I can work on my rhythm. I have a computer at home and every day I could take one or two hours for my studies. We can study all the aspects, for example: - Writing with the grammar problem, Speaking, Listening, Understanding I like the methode. Furthermore one being regularly noted we see its progress and the study rank is good for competition. For these various reasons I am interested in your curriculum. I would like to have a training plan. Sincerely,

      The company needed to save money so our manager informed us he had to lay off one employee by six and the he was going to meet uh in turn. As for me, I suggested he examine my way because I should agree, according to conditions, to leave the company. In fact I was department's oldest employee and I was going to retired one year later and what's more he anyway ought to replace me by somebody. It was also an opportunity to promote in the staff instead of creating bad morale and concern. I said he needed to take I was higher salary into account. The manager thanked ant told me he was going to meet my others colleagues and make his decision next week.

      It is a song by Josh Woodward called &quot;Home Improvement&quot;. The melody is very great and calm. When you listen this kind of music you would like to sleep on you bed and  think about in other life like a dream. But the singer speaks about a sentimental and problems, it's a sad story. The singer have a nice voice, but on the long time that can be borring to listen he. Because his voice doesn't change during the song. It is a good song when you went to sleep soon, and it isn't a good idea if you wake up and you want to be ready to work.

You imagine my fair. I'm so surprising, she could shoot me. A little moment after a passey-by caught her by the hair and surprise it was a wig. The young woman was a teenage boy. They managed to run away and henceforth I am too much afraid to go out my home. Best Regards Bob

      About the future don't gorget all is possible, no limits!For the record, in 1880 the French Autor Jules Verne write a novel &quot;From Earth to the Moon&quot;. Never we could imagine at this time that the man can reach the moon but in fact in 1969 Neil Armstrong landed on the moon.I'm sure the Future will be different. The Ttransport will be increasingly expensive. That's why I guess we will use new technologie to work at home.With the decrease of fossil energy we will use other sort of energy  as solar or wind energy.With the development  artificial intelligence I think that could be the new Technology Revolution as well as Internet was.We must  care of our footprints. I hope we have other consumption habits in the future.Currently we see the developpment of the social networks. Perhaps that will affect the structure of the relationship between the people and why not in the family. The future is in your hands!

      Dear Sir or Madam, I'm writing to you to request a loan to buy the appartment that we presently rent. I think it's a very important decision for me and my family. My wife and me would like to be more independant on the landowner. It be also a very good opportunity to save money. The fact we can obtain some tax deduction is a good point for us. Please find enclosed our financials figures including our expenses, savings and income. As you see, we have been able to save $10 000 during the last 5 years. If our calculation are exact, the mortgage would be around $800 per month then as we presently pay $950 for the rent. Please do not hesitate to contact us for further information Yours sincerely, Brice Granaud

      In 1983 the french parliament voted a law on the base of which the equality of treatment between men and women became a general rule. Why do men should be more paid or more quickly promoted than women ? During the last thirty years, the goverments had to do actions for the 1983's rule to be respected. In spite of that there remains differences even though, we can notice that a few companies has decided to practice a strict equality of salary. Sometimes it's a way to appear as socially respectful because it's a criteria to be chosen by a new kind of active shareholders. Will the money change the mentalities ? That sounds a little strange

      I feel strongly that the tv shows in my country are very silly,boring and full of commercial breaks. We almost watch the commercials more than the program.  The presenters are unprofessional. They make a bad humor and ask a wierd questions to the guests. Commercials are worst. We saw the same commercial again and again until we memorized the jingle. In my opinion the tv program of my country was better in the 90s. I loved that period. We need to ask for The best quality programs and more restrictions on commercials.

      My girlfriend used to date this guy in her office. They broke up after almost 18 months. It was a bit tough for both of them after that, working in the same office and seeing each other every day, but they ended up being really good friends. I wish all relionships could end end like that. The guy eventually met someone else, and they ended up getting married. My girlfriend was even invited to the wedding, but she didn't go because the guy's new wife hates her. The wife knows about the previouss Relationship, and she's really jeallous. Anyway, the other night my girlfriend was at the same party as this guy, and she wanted to congratulate him for getting a promotion, so she gives him a big hug. No kiss or anything-she just put her arms around him. Just at that moment, the wife walks up and gets really jeallous. My girlfriend said her face was all red. She was so angry that she threw her glass of wine in her husband's face and ran off. Can you believe it ? Talk about awkward!

The CEO anounced justly that the main item of the agenda  was to discuss about ideas to gain market share. After several interventions, they conclude that company need to expand abroad. According the COO, it will be the best solution and the most efficient to improve financial results. However, the CFO noticed that kind of project need time and money. He thinked it is a huge investment and it would take times to absorb it. CFO's speech opened new discussions, and disagrees came up. The CEO concluded in saying that all had to take times to think, and he decided to plan an other meeting in two weeks.

Line up the bottles in rows of 4, then 3, then 2, then 1- just like ten-pin bowling. Give each player a frisbee and allow to take two shots on each turn. Give to players a total of ten turns each. One point is scored for each pin that is knocked down. The player with the most points wins. Don't play this game on a very windy day.

      The office culture where I work is quite cool but strange. I can wear a jean, a t-shirt, or a pull over every day. There are about 4 people in the office (included me), and I'm just friendly with my other colleague. Indeed, the others people are.... the manager and his wife! It's difficult because they are always stressed out and they have a closed state of mind. Furthermore, they keep profits for themselves, so we never get bonuses. In my opinion, I think that's a dangerous situation for the manager, because we have anymore reasons to stay motivated. All people work 39 hours a week, more or less. It's hard to have a healthy work-life balance. I take around 5 weeks vacation each year, as stipulated in my contract. (What a pity, I had so many things to tell about this) Take Care ;)

      It was a very intensive meeting. At the beginning, we were all disagree because it's a very difficult position for our company. We are in financial trouble and it's necessary to find a solution very quickly. So the CEO said that we will have to close the doors if we refuse a merger with a more big company. But a lot of employees disagree this possibility because it will be dangerous for our specificity. We are a little compagny with a lot of new ideas and it's dangerous to be mixed with others. So it was impossible to find our way and we schedule another meeting next week. Perhaps it's dangerous to delay the decision, but what is done is done....

      I am rather pessimistic about the future. Even if technology will allow to more people to access to health, food,communication and perhaps clean water, I am afraid that the human minds will not improve so quickly, and that pollution and religious conflicts will cause wars all around the world. Will the Earth be able to feed 10 billion people in this context ? I would like to believe it, but it seems too optimistic.

      In France, respecting work hours is very important. You can't work more than you have to if you are an employee. If you are an executive, it's different. You have to work a lot and very late in the evening. If not, it seems you are probably not efficient or reliable or perhaps not very interested by your company. About vacations, it's really different, the country is stopped during summer, in august, so everybody is in hollidays, even executives. We have to say that  little by little all that is changing now,. In more companies they have not anymore to wear the suit, relationships are less and less formal, they are more true and friendly, more like a team !

      Your restaurant is very nice. The meal was good but it would be better if the food was fresh. There was too much food in my plate. I can't eat half of my main course! You should serve less food but with a better quality. Anyway the service was great, the waitress was very nice and polite. Oh! I forgot the cocktail, It's was delicious with not too much sugar.

The Great Wall oh China was our best memory. This country is very especially because we have met a lot of people so different. I liked already Asia but after this travel I went to live in this part of world. Unlikely my wife  don't leave France because the asia's meal wasn't good. Perhaps I could move out when I shall retired.

You'd be outside all day long with amazing animals around you. I urge you to apply for the job. Morover, the salary is by far the highest you can find in this field. Imagine! 50,000 dollars including 1 month of holliday and a full accident insurance. And the last amazing thing is that you should go for regular trips to Florida to observe wild crocodiles. I definitely encourage you to apply ! Let me know your feeling about it.

      I've never gave any presentation myself, however I've once seen one, about a French painter called Hopper. It was about a lot of his paintings and it was kind of boring, as the woman who spoke was very slow, I mean, she spoke slowly and with te same tone. Furthermore, something that was really annoying was that when she was speaking, something in her mouth made a weird noise because of her saliva. Concerning her presentation itself, it was really boring because we only saw paintings, nothing else ! She didn't do any conclusion, she just thanked us and we went away. The worse of all is that she showed us all the paintings while we were supposed to see them afterwards ! It was the most boring presentation I've ever been too ! One more thing is that she was so uninteresting that everyone was sleepong, even the teachers who came with us !

So, don't worry: you are different of your age group but the world is most interesting with different people. If everybody was same, the world would be boring! Take Care Mary

      I recently viewed a meeting between the actors, then he insisted on the cost for making it, and on the market share necessary. Finally he summarized the story, but, it was a shame. He told us the end without thinking nobody would like to know it because there would be now no supense to go out to the cinema and buy one ticket. I think audience, actors, directors and even productors are really not happy by this presentation.

      Yesterday, I heard the news about the hurricane who gone through The Reunion Island. The warning was announced few days ago, so all people was informed. At this time, one person died and many overs were hospitalized. But the biggest problem is the power cut. Thousands people have no electricity and Island authorities think that they will need at least three days to restore all the power. Of course, the damages are important. Some roads are destroyed, there are many trees broken on the roads, the damages cost was evaluated to several thousands of Euro. But for the weather forecast, it would have been worst...

The first is that his team is understaffed and overworked, second , they also said to Jed that they have a lack of resources and in the last one of their concerns , they are underestimated . For the Jed's team needs , I noticed the most important : They need some incentives and bonuses in order to re-motivate the team , also they need that the board hire other persons to join the team who's overworked.The team have to know also if they can be paid for the overtime .It's important to decide quickly and find the right issues about those reclamations , in other hand the situation will deteriorate .

      At the beginning, Pascal described the main steps of the project. Then he described the different actors whose our project requires. Then the engineers had time for asking questions. Pascal answered at many questions, but the project is not enough advanced in its analyse for answers at all points. Pascal noted the questions without response for analyse after. He thanked everybody. He thought the meeting was very instructive due to the different points that the engineers had raised. This project seems enough difficult because there will be many tasks to do at the same time and many actors to manage.

      In a few month you will elect new student council President, here below are all the points that I really hope will make you vote for me: first of all what we need is healthy and nice places for studying, I promise that some classrooms will be repainted, all chairs and desks repaired. Moreover I find it important to find some funds in order to help poorer students for participating to trips or get access to some activities. In order to succeed in it I'll contact our city Mayor who's socialist policy is really involved in student life, which is a good thing. I would like to point out as well that we'll manage to get a better price for coffee and chocolates, I have already contacted different suppliers that promised to rise down their prices. Of course if you want to change other things I would be listening to you. You have to be conscient that I really want to improve students life, that's why I'am applying for Student council President and asking you to vote for me. Thank you!

      When I was young, to keep myself informed about the news, I had three possibilities: read the newspapers, watch television or listen to the radio. The most common way was watching TV because we had both: the informations and the images of the events. But, since the early 2000s, a new genre of media appears: Internet. At first, it was like the newspapers, we only had informations and some pictures to illustrate them; but as time went by, as the internet network improved, so today we can watch the news online at any time, and everywhere. In fact, tablets, e-readers and smartphones are more and more widespread, so it's easier to read a book while commuting or while we are in a waiting room. Digital media has taken a huge place in our life, it's still improving every year, so I wouldn't be surprised if, unfortunately, someday the former mass media like newspapers would disappear.

      In France, we have a lot of tv programs from USA. In my opinion these programs are too violent. But Tv channels bosses know that the only way to have more viewers is to show some shocking programs. In France we don't have enough educational programs. TV programs are either violent or silly. I feel strongly that TV has to be educational. We have only one educational channel, National Geographic. It's a very good Tv channel, where we can watch a lot of interesting documentaries.

      In France, gallantry is very important, this is a national pride. It is mainly about relations between men and women. A gallant man open the door for a woman to let her pass before him . In the street, the man reserves the curbside to a woman, in order to protect her from possible risks that come from the street. At the train station, at the airport, this is the man who take care of the heavy luggage, he'll help mount the luggage of a woman, to place it in the compartment of a train for example. At the restaurant, a man slightly pull the seat to invite a woman to sit down. The man serving drinks to the woman,  he offer dishes first, pays the bill at the restaurant.

I was really upset because he was living without goals, usually going out in the night and sleeping all the day. He met a girl and she was really crazzy about him as though he was not confident himself. She'd want to get married and to start a family. She said that he should be liable and find a job to get money. As he does and he came back to school to be graduate. Good work ! I'll let you know what happens. Take care.

      Dear Board of Directors,I'm writing with regard to some issues with one of our managers. Jed, the Product Manager, has been having some concerns with his team. It seems that they feel that they are understaffed and overworked. They have a lack of resources and feel under appreciated despite the hard work they provide. I think we definitely need to offer some incentives to re-motivate his team like an overtime pay and bonuses. Maybe, we could think of recruiting more staff as well. I would like to suggest that we urgently arrange a board meeting so as to address these important issues before the situation deteriorates more.Jed and I are available next Tuesday afternoon around 14.30 or Thursday morning at 08.30. Please let me know which day and time slot would be more convenient for you as soon as possible. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon.Best regards,Emmanuelle Fournier

      The song &quot;Home improvement&quot; is a very good one and even if it's my fisrt time to hear it, 'I'm fond of. First because of the so energic rhythm which invits us to dance in it and second the clear guitar music is pleasant to listen to. It looks like a song from the eighties and it doesn't feel much of egerly. It's a very easy melody that we can repeat all the day long and that can become a catchy music for everyboly.  At the end, the singer's voice is also pleasant because that seems easy for her without shouting or singing too loud

      Put 10 plastic bottles with a little water (the bowling pins) in rows of 4, then 3, etc. on the bowling alley (8m x 3m).Give a frisbee to each player and, on each turn, every one can take two shots. Score one point for each kocked down pin. If in one shot, none stay (strike), take two more shots and add the points. The aim of this game is to have the most points, so to knock down the most pins.

      In Korea, there are many TV shows. I'm amazed at how violent these programs are. Even if the program is rating as G, there is always some sexual or violent scenes which is not educational for children. As the number of channels increases, broadcasting stations compete with others to get the highest audience rating and they make programs more sensational. Children are being exposed to these programs. Sometimes, they imitate what they've seen on TV whether it is violent or not. Because it's just exciting for them. We should let them know how dangerous it is and help children to watch good programs.

He wants to be a champion of every cause . It suppose that he always wants to be under the spotlight .

In my opinion, it's up to us to decide what we want to see.  We have already educational programms for the children.

      Thanks everybody for the notes, but I'm sorry I can't believe all the gossips. In fact, it's true that Gavin has seen a girl but it was just to prepare a surprise to Alana's birthday today. Trust me I was there and helped us to do! It's unbelievable, nobody wants to give a chance to a simple lovely thing. if they see something it will be straight a gossip. So, now I hope it will be an old gossip.

      We are going to adopt in my country a very strange law relating to the right to abort. This right was granted to women in 1976 provided their pregnancy was less than 10 weeks . Nothing else was required and in particular the position that the father may have has not been taken into consideration. It is a right that women have Some associations since 1976 have raised relevant issues following the implementation of this law . Among others the fact that the number of abortions was supposed to decrease while it remains stable at 200 000 per year or the need to properly inform those who have decided to abort about all the aspects of an abortion. Now our new government wants to adopt a law that will forbid any kind of information which could be considered as 'against abortion' , typically some websites , family advisors or even priests . Apparently authorities are fearing a new position of a significant part of the population who consider that we have gone to far as basically we can do almost anything that we want with the 1976 law and its subsequent amendments. It looks pretty strange to face such a situation in a country that claims that it is the country of the human rights and freedom of expression !%%!

      According to the legislation in France, French employee have to work 35 hours a week and can take 5 weeks holidays each year. I can only speak for myself but I've never had the chance to only work 35 hours a week ! In my office, there are 3 categories of employees : the first category have to work 37 hours a week, the second have to work 40 hours a week and the third and last category is free to work the amount of hours ones want and has an extra 10 days or so of holidays.

3540,"I'd like to present you what kind of different renewable energy sources we can use.There are five type of energy source: solar power, hydroelectricity, tidal energy, wind power and bio mass .The less expensive is tidal power. It consists to  convert  the energy of the oceans in electricity. It is environmentaly-friendly .Hydroelectricity can be use too. It's a little bit more expensive. They use the gravitional force of the river.After that you have wind power. The cost is more important and it is necessary to have a strong wind .At the end  we have solar power. You must have a lot of money because you have a high installation costs and you must have a lot of sun . As we can see it's not easy to make a choice about what will be the renewable energy that will be the more efficient in the future. We have voluntary  excluded the biomass because we don't have enough information about that. Now you are able to make a good choice. Thank you .

We need to take the time to analyze our personality, our style of life and try to match these characters with a job that permit us to reach our fulfillment.The excerpt is a good exemple of analysis needed before start a job campaign and it gives us the ingredients of success. In the other hand, the article claims a set of actions difficult to realize, 'what do we want' is not simple question to express and 'what do we are' is even more difficult.In any cases, the excerpt is a good step to start begin find a job but the resolution of career path dilemma will continue to follow us for entire life.

      In my opinion all the manners looklike almost the same in the world with just few differences concerning the celebrations and what kind of &quot;party&quot; or occasion could be. Per example, as I am from France, if you're invited to go in friend's house for dinner it's normal to bring a bottle of wine or some pastries or flowers also. But for this kind of dinner, there is no special clothes that you have to wear, altough it's better to wear clean and appropriate clothes. But, if it's for a wedding or a birthday and you will meet people that you never seen before it could be more appropriate to wear suit for men and dress for women. Concerning the manner during the dinner, the main guidelines are to wait before to eat that all the people are ready to eat, no drink too much alcohol, don't put the elbow on the table... In my experience, as I travelled a lot in Asia, I could see that is really diferent from European culture. Per exemple, my Asian Friends don't understand why French people stay during few hours during a dinner or lunch even for birthday or other kind of celebration.

      As an advocate of socialist, I can be your best choice to fit the position of your council president. Here are some reasons. First, I am supporting the idea of playing as well as working. So, the numbers of after class activities will not be cut down, we will have as much ball as before. Meanwhile, I plans to found study groupes. This will not only help us to review the important points of class, but also does it develop our abilities of team work. Second, I will struggle for the sport activities funds. We will not be arounded of the old, useless sport equipements. The last, I'd like to establish a council meeting each month. Everyone could give out their idea, suggestion or plans about our school life, you all will have chance to participate the student council decisions. Thanks for you all, and waiting for your vote to give me a chance to prove my words.

      Home improvment is a protest song of Josh Woodward, one of his earliest songs, very different from the later ones. The singer talks about the life in his home town and makes a criticism of the American consumer society.

And i will sue you for the money due if i do not receive a positive response to this letter.furthermore, you know me as a well-organised and goal-oriented employee and it will just a lost to not count me under your team.yours sincerely,

However, i'm also pessimistic because unless we reduce our gazoline consumption, pollution will increase and air quaility will get worse. To summarize, we need to undestand that the development of technology will make our life getting easier and better, but unless we take action to coordonate and regulate of environmental issues such as pollution, we won't take advantage of all the profit that the future has to give to us.

      Are gender differences still in force in French society? the answer is not easy. at work, many actions have been taken to promote women with the same conditions offered to men. However, women have to make a break in their carreer to bring up children, they can be considered less available because of their family contrains, French mentality is evolving and men are more and more involved in family daily affairs,  more and more women get upper work position but it seems that it remains a challenge for women to achieve their professional targets; besides salary increase is slower for women than for men

      What's the difference between TOEIC and TOEFL? The first point to make would be that they are both test proficiency in English. On the one hand TOEIC is used above all by employers, but on the other hand, that also can be used by school as a placement test, especially for business-oriented students. Secondly, employees who want to get an overseas job take TOEIC, whereas students take TOEFL. You have to take in consideration that the second one is not only the realm of studies, but also a good way to get a scholarship for exchange programs. Therefore, to be more precise, TOEIC is English test for work, whereas TOEFL is English test for academic studies. However, both require a high-level in English. These are just the biggest differences between TOEIC and TOEFL. Consequently, ready to make your choice? As far I'm concerned, the more suitable for me would be TOEIC. Why did I choose this one? Basically, because my studies are far away from me now. At the same time, I'm hopeful that one day I could live overseas...so, why not?

First, it allows me to join anybody, anywhere at anytime by texting without disturbing which is making  me rethink  of how to make a good use of  a banal  phone.  Before,  I'd been phoning even for giving a piece of information,  which was wasting my time. Then, wherever I am, I can quickly research my way when I am travelling or  book a hotel and it's really convenient ! Finally, I can do without my computer and my smartphone and that  is what I try to fight!

      In france , the most famous architecture visited is &quot;la tour Eiffel&quot;. It so unique that you can't see nowhere in the world except in Paris. Maybe you can see some copy in Las vegas or in a small town in China. But the real one is the most amazing architecture. If you go in Paris , you should visit the Eiffel tower inside and up to see Paris a litlle closer from the sky. The view is really incredible that you can see &quot;l'arc de triomphe&quot; , &quot;la tour Montparnasse&quot; and &quot;la Dfense&quot;. There are some building in &quot;La Defense&quot; , it's an area for the business but it is not also amazing like Manathan.

Moreover, my cabin was little and dirty. I even found some roaches in the bathroom. That wasn't as comfortable as I read in your booklet. The captain was impolite and inattentive. Last but not least, the package didn't include all expenses and I had some extra and hidden charges, like insurance for example. We look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely, Michael Pousse

      Impressionist Wing: The movement began in Paris. Impressionist painters preferred to paint outside and they studied the effect of natuaral light on objects. Claude Monet: 'The Road Bridge at Argenteuil' in 1874. It was painted on site and shows the boats on the River Seine. Exhibit ends on 3 January. Expressionist Wing: Part of the permanent collection, closes on 1 October to make some changes. Franz Marc: ' The Blue Rider'. He devoted much of his career to painting horses and other animals. His compositions were radical and he experimented boldly with color to express the primitive energy of animals. This movement ended with the outbreak of World war I. Cubist Wing: Opens 1 October and it runs through to 31 March. Part of the permanent collection. Cubism was initiated by the Spanish artist Pablo Picasso and the Frenchman George Braque in Paris before WW1. This movement often shows multiple viewpoints of one figure. George Braque: 'Le Jour' (1929). Still life done in greens, grays, ochers and browns. Various objects are shown fragmented, as if seen from multiple viewpoints.

      Personally, I belong to the first generation which was born with the new technologies of information and communication, so I haven't really known a change. TV, cellphone, desktop, internet : I was born with all that kinds of media. Indeed, nowadays, desktop are rather old-fashioned; laptops and tablets are trendier but it's not a huge change. I mean, for example, last month I tidied the cellar up with my mother when I saw a sort of box, big as pocket book. I asked to my mother what it was and she tells me : &quot;oh! it's your father's walkman!&quot; This old walkman was like a prehistorical thing for me, but in fact it is the ancestor of the mp3. It's paradoxal because things have changed so fast that people with just 3 years of gap haven't had the same technological references. Then, I haven' known the cellphone, big as a &quot;phone cab&quot;. My first cellphone was a smartphone, it's a bit weird to imagine a cellphone without the camera application, an internet access, etc. I guess it's what we call the &quot;generational conflict&quot;, but I am aware of the luck I have to live with all this media and the issue in terms of security of private life that it can represent.%%

      A first, I met sylvain and sebastien when I arrived in annemasse, in my new school. They are twin. They was funny and very open-minded. We all played soccer at this time and I was looking for a club. So, I went to play with them in their little soccer club. Then, we went together to a lot of parties. Next, I went to one university with Sylvain, and after that,another university with Sbastien. They and I are very old friends. I've knowed them for about 20 years. I helped one of them to meet his wife at university. Now, when I see them, I play with their little children and we speak about good times.

      My colleague, Martin is by the far the best I have known in our business. Since he began working with us, the turnover is increased gradually. He is so meticulous therefore he never wants sharing the task. He prefers bringing back the task at home rather asking help from someone else. He is very competitive and challenging, all our colleagues appreciate him; he is always in good mood. Despite all these qualities he is not very serious he is always late at work, but nobody doesn't care because he finishes his job on time. Soon he will be retired and our boss is looking for a new employee, but it seems difficult for him he used to have the perfection.

      In my country, Brazil, the school system is different from US. Generally the students go to school only a few hours a day. There are two sessions one in the morning and other in the afternoon. But the grade it's similar from US. If you are at college you can choose also night courses. Usually people who works during the day chose the night courses. It's not unusual for wealthy people to go to public university. They have the best teachers and courses. It's unfair for the most part of population who needs to pay a lot of money for study. I'm in favor to public school for all the people.

      In France, there are striking differences between males and females. For example , a man who has his first date , He often invites the woman to a good restaurant and he usually pays the bill, why? At work, why a man is better paid than a woman for doing the same job? Why it is always more difficult for a women to get a job with the same experiences and skills? In the day life , women always take care with the food, with the health. On the other hand men prefer enjoy each moment of the life, so they eat much more, they drink much more. There is an exception, women smoke more than men. Few years ago it was exactly the opposite. Nowadays, men smoke less and less while women smoke more and more. I don't know why.

      Good manners and etiquette. Ahhhh it's a good and major issu  in some countries. I'm very frustrated when I see some bad manners where I travel to. In France, we have some etiquette used when you receive host for a dinner. For example if your host is a woman, when greeting her you have to kiss his right hand. This etiquette is used by the France president when he receives important host: wives of presidents of other countries, etc. An other etiquette is you can't leave table before your host when dinning. This etiquette is also observed by the France president for important dinners with important personalities. So, if a foreign visitor (a woman) want to visit France, she souldn't be chocked when people will kiss his right hand to greet her. You know, France is a country where people attach importance to good manners and etiquette. That's why, before visiting a country like France, people should learn about local good manners.

      Maybe someday in France we'll have gender equality but today a lot still can be done ! The salaries for the same functions and diplomas are different until now, shouldn't women get equal pay for equal work ? These last years, we can see more and more women in the highest job, and they are really brilliant ! Nevertheless we can see that a majority of women have the low jobs, probably because they stay at home to raise their family for several years and in this case they cann't be preoccupied by their career. At home generally women still do more than men, even if it's better than thirty years ago.... Perhaps we are too conservative in France than in the northen countries ?

      I think that in my country, in France, children are watching really too much the TV, and they are not always watching a program for their age. They feel boring about read a book, or going outside with their friends. And for the other, programs in the evening are always the same, detective story, like NCIS, FBI, and some other. And if you don't like that, you just can watch silly reality show or boring soap opera. It would be better, with some different movies, comedy, action, or anything else, but real movies

      La Charrue is my favourite restaurant, they have so many Alsacian speciality. The most important speciality dish is the &quot;tarte flambe&quot;, it's like a pie but with a very fine paste with some cream, onions and bacon on it. Otherwise they propose so many other main course. For exemple you can take a &quot;Tarte flambe&quot; for appetizer and after a &quot;fleischnecke&quot; (other very good speciality) and to finish you can order an amazing dessert, all desserts are home made. The prices are raisonable but you have to reserve because this restaurant is everytime full.

      In France, people work about 35 hours a week more or less. However, CEOs work more than 35 hours a week because of their responsabilities. They can make 50 hours a week.. It depends. Get a good working-life balance is not easy. Indeed, the purchasing power decreasing year to year which affect people work. They want to work more, to earn more. That is why they may feel exhausted, or have health problems.

      Today, we have  lot of channels with the cable tv. You can see very interesting programs but also very silly ones such as reality shows. I think there's a lot of violence. In France, we have even special channels about murders, crimes. If a kid or a fragil person  sees these programs, it could be very shocking for them.  I agree with the tv rating but I' m not sure about its efficiency. People like to overpass the forbidden things ! So, we have to be very attentive to what children see and we have to discuss with them about it.

      My president, Mr Hollande, is someone I wasn't used to admire. But the thing is that the past week, he went further in his concept of &quot;normal&quot; president and that deserves some respect. I admire him because he showed to the whole world the &quot;normal&quot; habits of presidents, of people who have some power and sometimes over use it. Mr Hollande is well-known for his little jokes, he is quite funny but not with what he says, mostly with what he does. For instance, one of his favourite habit was to see his paramour in secret : that was the last thing expected from him as far a his popularity was so low. But even in that hard situation, he found the mean to make laugh half the planet, including all his opponents and all the leaders who see him as a fool, not even able to be discret, as they perfectly are...

      Hi Ian, How are you doing? I have heard of your resignation letter due to claustrophobia, and I really think there's another way to solve the problem. I know you may feel uncomfortable that I bring up this subject, so I have to assure you that there is no shame to talk about it. More people than you might think suffer from this kind of irrational fear. The good news is that lots of claustrophobia patients recover definitely from this decease, so there's a hope for you as well. Most of medical treatments are based on relaxation techniques and getting familiar with enclosed spaces. I have read a leaftlet on one of those methods, called Cognitive Behavior Therapy(CBT). I would highly recommend yougetting more information on it. Drop me a line as soon as possible.  See you.

      If one of my friends would come in french university it will be difficult for me to talk about my own experience. Because I'm 46 the world of education (after high scool) is an unknown reality. I mean it's very far of my actual life, and it's not my main concern. Nevertheless, I believe that french public education offers many and varied possibilities.It depends on the time that you want study. You can study in 2 or 3 years after high school for learn a manual or technic job. How long does it take to train as an engineer? Five years... I don't know if french universities are competitive or efficient. May be are they behind the others in USA,  I really don't know. But our system is open for foreign students and the cost of inscription in public universities is not very expensive.

      I'm not at the top with manners or etiquette but definitely you have to follow few elementary rules when you are in a social occasion. For example you are invited to a dinner party, it's polite to answer rapidly. It's also very thoughtful to offer a small gift such as a bottle of wine for a man and a bouquet of flowers for a woman. Don't bring an expansive present, it could be embarrassed the other guests. Please don't sit at the table before your hosts have said to you, don't begin to eat before them, don't put your elbows on the table, don't forget to put your napkin on your lap and almost switch of your cell phone. Once you're back at home, think to send quickly a thank by a card or an email. An other example, suppose a while you are in a big city and you take the tube to move and the tube is full, please leave your seat for an old person or a pregnant woman. If you are a man and you get into a restaurant, enter the first to make sure everything is right inside.%%

The first thing is that you must thrust to others; You have to give your ideas; they will all be analysed intern and evaluated. If the teamsignals a good idea which can help the company to win some money, this team will be recompensed by a price like a check. For new projects, we'll carry out a SWOT  analys before his beginning. Every body will be involved. If somebody has a problem or even another idea, we'l be happy to study it.

I advise you to follow those some rules please. Now, I explain the rules which are not mandatory. When you were invited to your friends, you can bring a wine bottle or bunch of flowers, you can share hands of your co-worker in entering and in exiting. Those rules help for good understanding .

      I remember when I started my career, one of our clients convened our sales director to complain about the delay of project. I was so nervous that I couldn't even focus in my work. Indeed, the client decided to give up the contract that he already had signed with my company. It was an awkward situation. My director went to meet our client with the certitude that not only he were going to stop their professional relationship but also were going to demand damages. After this meeting, our sales director assured us that he finished it in good terms and better he could negotiate another contract. What a good surprise! I can't help myself asking him how he finally managed to correct and reverse this situation in our favour. He simply explained me that he could reach his goal in two steps. First, when the client was still angry, he stayed in his control, he listened to him carefully, he showed a sincere empathy and he apologized for the delay. Then, once our client became calm, he proposed him the best way our company was going to resolve his matter as soon as possible. Plus, he dared make an offer to him about our new product and he convinced him to sign another contract.%%

Twice a day you'll have to walk with dogs, but if it's raining, you can play games with us in the house. Don't forget to feed the dogs every night and the birds every afternoon. You'll have to check birds water twice a week. The last recommandation is to take out the trashes on Tuesday night. Thank you very much for your help! Best wishes! Ben

      2 years ago when the bottom dropped out of the Greece economy, all the people in europe felt the consequences. The banks were affraid and they didn't want to lend money. So companies were broke and they sacked a lot of people. And with no job and with an increase of the cost of life, people were strapped for cash. The main course was so just getting by and had a roof over their heads. But we can hope that now things are finally turning around and people can pick up some job. Because if they have a job, the money management will be more easy and people more happy.

      Dear Steve, I am aware of the dangers of this extreme sport and thanks for your encouragement but could you give me much details? For me skydiving is a dream but I have a responsible behavior in my life and I would like to have more confident for my first jump. How many lessons I needed before jumping I don't know how pack and open a parachute. If I'm scared have you an instructor to explain me two times? If I have injured have you a medical assistance on the place and where is the nearly hospital? My parents and my friends asked me all this questions and I would like to answer them. I'm ready for the first lesson and I wait your reply. See you soon. Regards. Yolande

      Just few words about Gavin Taylor because I'm not used to gossip. For information, I was one of his best friends as we were students. I think he is still honest with the person who's sharing his life. So, I think he is unable to cheat with another woman and be sure that Gary and Alana are still in love. I also think that people always gossip about celebrities. The idea that's they are about to break up is a rumour which is spreading on the network. Please, pay caution with this kind of conspiracy.

      I just heard a beautiful song by Josh Woodward. It's a folk-rock tune with a traditional walking bass and a simple harmony in C sharp major. Overall, the line bass conducts the band and keep the strong beat with drums. I note the high range of the bass player. Unfortunately the keyboard player doesn't improvise seriously.  This song is pretty catchy and you can really dance rock on it. The singer doesn't have much a range but his voice is good in a country style with political and sad lyrics. I recommend this music when you want a beat and some politics in a song.

      Judith Wight's &quot;How to Make A Career Out of Courage&quot; explores how to find a job that corresponds with one's personality. Judith Wight claims that it's a common occurrence in life to search for a new and more gratifying career and that's easy to determine which job corresponds with one's personality. According to Judith Wight, the key to avoid feeling dissatisfied at work is to match one's personality and interests to a profession before beginning the job's search. Someone would get it taking a long hard look at himself in the mirror and asking himself what would make him happy at work?! If this book makes readers feel like they've finally found someone who understands them, the claims are so unrealistic that I feel it's just a little far-fetched. It sounds like a bad fairy-tail, so far from the day to day reality of job and career!

      How To Make A Career Out Of Courage by Judith Wight gives leads to change into a career that fits our personality and interests.According to the writer, a person will change of career between five and seven times in its lifetime. So, being in the good career path is not easy. Judith Wrights self-help book aims to give some advice to find a satisfying job. Her advice can be summed up in two simple steps: first, learn about yourself personality, interests and working style. Then, go online and do one of the many career tests. Judith Wrights book is very motivational. After reading it, I feel like I may find my dream job and succeed in a new career that better matches my personality. However, her speech suffers from a lack of reality. If a person does not find its dream job, it may be because of the condition of the economy or the employment market. The author does not explore this issue.In conclusion, I have to say that her book may give some hopes and good leads to those who are lost in their career. Thats a good start! But, do not expect too much.

      I have always hated extreme sports. Not only I feel scared of speed but I also feel afraid of height. I have never been a thrill-seeker, in fact my favourite sports are swimming, tennis and Zumba. No place in my mind for danger, speed or the possibility of an accident. When my first son was six years old he asked me to go to the mountain. I agreed to the idea of spending some days riding peacefully in the nature. Unfortunately my husband and my son were looking forward to take some downhill skiing training. I didnt have the choice, on one hand I didnt want to stay alone in the hotel waiting for them to return in the afternoon, instead of spending the day outdoors under the sun and surrounded by a magnificent nature. On the other hand I knew that if I didnt try almost once, Ill never hear the end of it. We have been practising skiing for the last five years. Im not very bad skier and Im able to ski on the red piste but Im always as scared as the first day; not only because of the speed but above all, because of the other skiers.%% The idea of hitting someone or falling down because of an uncontrolled breakneck speed makes me crazy.

      I'm sorry but I really don't like American series. In my country on the first channel, every evening we can almost always watch a detective series and if there is no one we can watch a serie about life in a hospital. I'm amazed to see some much blood on TV. I prefer rather original movies or original series like &quot;games of Thrones&quot; or &quot;Oblivion&quot; or &quot;Kaboul Kitchen&quot; a french serie for the last. Our national channels are free of advertisment after 8.45 p.m. after the evening news, we are lucky, but on the others channels we can have two commercial breaks of about 7 minutes in a movie. The best for me is to watch TV on demand.

      If you have fever, you must wear socks soaked in vinegar and thyme. It's really efficient. Moreover, you can use garlic crushed with lemon and acerola.

      I have to manage a medical team in my private health center. It is always difficult to manage people who have studied more than five years... Because they feel they are smart enough to decide what they have to do. I think the more important point to manage this team is to develop mutual trust. Each time I toss around a new idea, I need several month to explain it many times before they become willing to commit. The french doctors earn money when they meet their patients. That is the reason why they think that meetings are waste time. I resolved this problem in organizing the meetings during lunch time. It has been also very hard to commit them to a new electronic record, with patient files kept up to date. I had to develop an comprehensive induction aroud the electronic system and the computers. Hard work to be manager of a medical team. You have to devote yourself to your team.

      Yesterday, a ship, which was carrying a lot of asylum seekers, sank off the coasts of Australia. The boat was located 120 miles away from the north of the Christmas island, reported the Australian authorities. Obviously, the captain of the ship sent an emergency call when it was no doubt that the crew would not be able to fix the problems. Fortunately, the emergency workers arrived very quickly on the area and they had succeeded in saving the 106 people, who were staying inside the boat, before this last one disapeared under the water. No information was given about the reasons of the shipwreck but, we can seriously imagine that there were too many people aboard regarding the maximum tolerated occupancy of the ship. The Australian authorities announced that the victims would not be authorised to stay and live in Australia. Actually, as soon as they are in better health, they will be sent back in their native land.

      I have to complain about your travel company: Blue Cruise Alaska. In your website, it's written that the trip looks ''spectacular and so unique'', and you assure that the boat is ''comfortable and cosy'', and more you say the captain is ''attentive''. Well, I have to inform you that this trip wasn't at all as you describe it. The boat was dirty, uncomfortable, and really awful. We hadn't seeing special animals like eagles, dolphins... And the captain was really unfriendly. I hope you will hear my complain because the condition of the travel was really terrible.

      I am really no good at music, but as a friend of mine ask me to talk about a song by Josh Woodward, I am going to try to play music criticals. I listened very carefully this song called &quot;Home Improvement&quot;, and I really can't say that I felt in love with it, far from it. But it is just a matter of taste, because the song is obviously a good quality one. &quot;Home Improvement&quot; has kind of a rocky-folk rhythm and a rather soft and nostalgic melody. Josh Woodward has a pleasant, sweat and clear voice, but as for me I find the song too soppy, and a little bit boring.

      Green business is a very good thing for the earth because it saves natural resources. It is difficult to buy only produts of green business. I must say that I don't go out of my way each day to buy green produts. I feel guilty not to do it more often, now I am writing these lines. It's beyond question. Maybe I am not so motivated I should do because of false green products. Sometimes, I can see green produts without any information about the origine or the way it has been manufactured. Other times, that is the packaging wich seems not green, even if they say the product is green. I can't always take their word for it. I hope we'll get green labels easy to understand and reliable for consumers. I have the same concern about ethic products. Some business is non ethic, with factories in some far countries, using workers in very bad conditions.

      I would like to explain what is the main principles of French school : 1/ State schools and private schools that have a contract with the state coexist within the state system. In exchange for signing a public contract, private schools benefit from state support but are subject to regulation and must respect the national curriculum. 2/ The curriculum and content of teaching have to respect the principle of neutrality. Teachers and pupils are required to show philosophical and political neutrality. 3/ The French school system has been based on the principle of secularism since the end of the 19th century. State schooling has been secular since the Jules Ferry Education Act of 28 March 1882. 4/ Schooling has been compulsory since the law of 28 march 1882. It is compulsory from the age of six for all French or foreign children of both genders who are resident in France. However (with a prior declaration) the family can home-school their children.

      Hi David, After our brainstorming meeting I think we have the best idea for our peanut butter. We can use a soap opera star to promote the brand. At the beginning, we thought about sports stars. But people just dont believe that world class sports stars eat as much peanut butter as they say they do in our ads. We have chosen soap opera star because people can relate to this person and believe that they really do eat peanut butter. If you agree with this idea I can take contact with Jerry Maddisson so as to start the shooting by next week.%% We have already worked with him. He is not as expensive as sports stars. I look forward to having your feedback Best regards Jawad

      What roles do males and females have in my country, I mean, in France? I think relationships between men and women exist with no contentious, in France. Of course, male chauvinism appears sometimes, but generally, males and females share tasks at home. No need having written rules, nor strict agendas. They are compatible and accept to change their role if it's necessary, but the problem is elsewhere. If you look at a picture of parliment. You can see the women are under-represented. A shame! A lot of improvements would be necessary to obtain an equal representation  males/females in high responsability jobs.

      Many years ago, when I was young I was travelling hitchhiking. I remember, once in Marseille, I met a girl hitchhiking, too. I've proposed her to travel together : it will be more secure for her and easier for me. We got a lift to Salon with two algerians guys. But they go out from the motorway, a few kilometers later. We were afraid and asked them : 'what happens?'. They went back on the motorway, and said : 'Are you afraid because we are algerian? Are you racist?'. The answer was obviously no.But before we arrived in Salon they go out the motorway again, and so we were in a clearing, with to guys whose intention was clearly to rape the girl. We have finally gone safe, but it has been a very long time, defending on the back of the car, dicussing and discussing. They often went to the car boot, to search what ? Guns, we didn't know. In fact there was nothing, but it has been a very scary evening.

      Josh Woodward's new song is named &quot;home Improvement&quot;. He's not used to sing song like that but his new style will surprise you by his truth. The music style is a mix of country and pop song. Josh is talking about his hometown and about the evolution of it. He's a little bit sad to see that all his environment is changing for better technologies and more rentability. He can't do anything about it and he was just looking what happens. I like this song because the singer seems truly sincere and really upset about his condition and the song's lyrics are a good choice. I hope Josh will feel better in the future in his hometown which will always stay his hometown, even if everything changes.

      Hydroelectricity To answer the issue of nonsutainables energies ued in our city. I believe that hydroelectricity is the best way to participate in the world movement to save our planete against polution and to reduce the use of fossil fuel. Hydroelectricity is produced through use of the gravitational force of falling or flowing water. And with that, we can provide &quot;green&quot; electricity to all the houses in the city. To install that, we need a strong river with a dam built across It. I have imediatly think about the river which flow near the village. We have all what need hydroelectricity, why don't use it ? Hydroelectricity no required fuel costs and relatively low building and maintenance costs. With my research, i deduce that it will cost the city $75,000 ( one of the cheaper sustanable energy). To finnish, i believe that hydroelectricity can be a way to give a good image to the city ( an &quot;eco-city&quot;). Iam really concerned about saving the planete and you should be to!

All the basements of the house nearer the river were filled with the water. The day before a tempest warning was announced and as it was one of the highest tide of the year, we were evacuated for security. The wind blew more than 130 kilometers per hour from the sea to the land. The tide was higher than usual stopping the flow of the river and the level of the water reached 1,5 meters over the previous biggest flood in 100 years. We realized it was a wise decision to evacuate because nobody was injured.

      I'm generally pessimistic about the future. The world leader strongly disagree about pollution laws, and developing countries will create more pollution that will be the main problem.

      Now let me talk about a great source of environmentally friendly energy : tidal energy.Everyone knows how solar panels or wind farms can help a city to generate renewable energy and reduce its consumption of fossil energy. But fewer are the ones aware of the earnings provided by the tidal energy. This is a form of hydro power that converts the energy of tides into electricity or other useful forms of power. Tidal waves move water into power turbines and that kinetic energy gets converted into electric energy. This could be a really useful source of power, considering the fact we are living in an island surrounded by an ocean. We have strong tides very often and we should definitely take advantage of it.Moreover, this solution has a relatively low cost and a low ecological impact. It will only cost the city 60,000 USD to install tidal systems, which is much cheaper than installing solar panels throughout the city. It is actually half the price of a solar installation for the same amount of power generated. In my opinion, it is the best solution for our city.

      In France, at the end of highschool, you can entrance different kinds of schools. Few decades ago, the trend was to go to University. I think it was because it was not very expensive (and it is still the case). I think it is a good solution only for serious and motivated students. Nowadays, lots of students try to entrence special classes to go, after two years, to a renowed school, such as the ENS if you want to become a teacher. Then, you can also go to a private school. The school fees, are sometimes expensive, but, then, you can get a good grade. In my opinion, the more you are motivated, the more you can succeed, so, your success doesn't only depend on the school reputation.

At this point the CFO said that the only way to improve it, was to merger with the French company. The CEO disagreed about the idea of a merger. He developped two main points to explain his refusal. On one hand the CEO considered that our company is strong enough to face the challenge of improving the figures sales. On the other hand he thought a merger involves to fire executives. At this point the CFO took the floor again, to say that the only person the board had to fire was the CEO! One of the bord director declared that he was aware of the rumors spreading in the company. He declared there were no point of firing someone. Instead of that, hi invited us to think on the ways we could amerliorate our team building because he was conviced our main problem was the lack of communication among the executives. That's the reason why the board director had decided to hire Ms Delgado as a specialist of communication. He introduced her an he took a date to organise a meeting between her and the team of executifs.%%

      In my home town in Nice, France. There is a building called &quot;La Tte Carre&quot; (The square head in English) rather unusual. It's an administrative building of the library of Nice. It measures 30 meters and it's only painted in grey. The feature of this building is half of a human head and half of a cube. The first half is a human head up starting from the neck to the inferior lip of 16 meters and the second half measuring 14 meters is a cube sheltering offices of the library. This building is rather recent, it was built in 2001.

      My experience in office politics is ordinary. Maybe I am a pessimist but I observed that most people, including myself, are rather coward.  It is easier to talk about somebody than to express directly what we feel or need or dispute. Foster team spirit may suppose to prevent gossips. It is not easy: psychologists notice that speaking ill of somebody is natural.  According to them, you can be proud of yourself when you succeed in limiting gossips at seven times a day!  At work everyone has to find the good distance, which means neither too close nor too far. Being interested in people is not being intrusive. In some companies you are asked to play tennis or golf as if your private life belonged to the company. I prefer the purpose of skills exchange networks that you can find in some public services. It helps people to know each other and create profitable relations to all. It is one of the tools of a winning winning strategy.

      Paris is a town steeped in history.The city is well-known for its marvelously preserved historic architecture.Paris is a most tourist-visited city  in the world. In my opinion ,the cause of this success is maintain of balance between modern and historic arcitecture.For example ,the modern very busy district La Defense is relatively separate of historic center. At the same time there is a system of modern and effective public transport.The Parisian museums The Louvre and Orsay are well-known collections ,it houses as ancient as contemporary sculpture and painting.Paris is a very green city ,there are a lot of picturesque gardens and beautiful parcs here.The most famous is Jardin de Tuileries ,near the Louvre museum and Jardin de Luxembourg.I would like to recommend You to visit The Notre-Dame cathedral ,situated on Cit island.

I think that more people spend a lot of time before the TV. This is a big problem. I think that the TV is dangerous and stupid for the people.

      I believe companies have a responsability to society, but like eveybody has. I mean, I cant stand the concept of irresponsibily, and Im deeply convinced that, whoever you are, whatever you do, unless you live alone in a remote island, you have a responsability to society. To my mind, the only difference lies in the spread of the aftermath. Therefore, the companies responsability is higher because they are more powerful, and all what they do impacts in a vaster medius. In one hand, companies cant dismiss their shareholders, to the extent that their money fuels their investments. Without them, they would belly up quickly and many employees would be laid off. Nevertheless, they must not consider only the shareholders interest. Too often, you hear about companies which shut down a factory in a country where workconditions are respectful of human dignity, in order to recreate it in another one, where children underfed will work at no cost, and in unsafe conditions. Thats outrageous. In the same way, it occurs that companies harm the environment deliberately to increase their profits. Thats outrageous as well. Therefore consumers must be vigilant and aware of their own responsability. Its up to everyone  not only to companies  that our world doesnt become a dog eat dog world.%%

The sky became very dark.Many big and thick clouds flought over them.The wind was likely been stronger (300 km/h).The waves hit the beach with incredible force .She was terrified. On the coast, houses mostly made in wood and sheets were picked and thrown across the beach; it was a disaster. Currently when she thinks about this natural disaster, she is still affected. She sees the beautiful area, people enjoying themselves on the sand and...then... this strong wind, this enormous wave wich all distroyed with incredible force, and nothing to do ...just remain calm, calm,...It makes her very sad just to think about it.

      I had been working for an insurance broker for five years. Prior to that I had been studying economics at university in Lyon. My company, after big losses, was sold. Unfortunately the relationship with my new boss was not as good as I expected so I decided to quit this job. Finally I end up applying for a insurance company specialised in liability. I worked for them in Lyon for one year. Subsequently they asked me to move to Rennes to work off site. It was something very new for my company and for me as well. The beginning was tough because I had never been in Rennes before and had no friends in this city. But thanks to this job, my situation is getting better and better. I have a good salary and they increase year by year my responsibilities. We are very lucky because the economic crisis didn't spoil our business and our market share is still growing. Looking to the future I would like to experience a job abroad that's why I practice english. Maybe in two or three years I would be an insurer in Budapest, a city where I met my wife four years ago.%%

      Each person has his own way of writing. For me, as a scientific, I prefer by far questionning and metaphor as a best writing techniques. First, when I want to keep the attention of readers I use some metaphors. It's always helpful when I write long texts that may seem boring because of many mathematical formulas and details of problem solving. For example, I can say when talking about the universe : &quot;The universe is continually expanding, but runs to its end as an Olympic champion&quot;. Also, I use a questionning technique as a way to help readers to ask them selves some questions about this subject, and make them responsive regard to what they read and to be other than a simple passive readers. So, when I write a subject, I start by asking my self all the questions that any reader can ask himself about what he read, and then I add another type of questions : the open questions.

      In France, there are some rules you have to know to don't be considered as a bad-mannered person. 1- At table, you should be careful of few gestures. For example when you are eating, you don't be allowed to put your elbows on the table, you have to eat with the mouth closed and not with hands. 2- It is impolite asking questions about the money you have or your salary, above all if you make much money. 3- Use the &quot;vous&quot; to speak in a professional situation or with person you don't know very well.

Maybe we will have robots to home who make the food for us and also other jobs. Maybe, the new technologies can devellopped the medicine or something else. i am very optimistic about the future.

      The love story between Isabella and John is amazing. In the one hand, money seperates the two lovers. But in the other hand, they fall in love. Quickly, they understand that their love is stronger than their difference. Nevertheless, Isabella is engaged with another man. If this man is as rich as Isabella, they haven't common qualities or common goal. Love will be stronger than the money. During the travel, they will live a beautiful love story.

      Dear Sarah, You know you're my best friend. So, despite I have swore not to say a word, I want to tell you something really weird about my sister and her husband. Promise you won't tell ? They decided to divorce. This is bad news but not so unexpected if I consider their relationship. What is really weird is that they decide to celebrate the event and to organize a &quot;divorce party&quot; like another wedding ceremony... I refuse to attend it ! Maybe, she'll wear her wedding dress again and their guests will throw some rice at the exit of the court. This is a bad joke, isn't it ?

      Sciences and technology are progressing more quickly every day, thats why our generation has to be more reactive than the previous ones. Social network hold an important place in our daily lives and we must maintain this lifestyle. Stay connected is the key to success. We communicate quickly and efficiently around the world. The important amount of information we are receiving every day is a real advantage.Regarding the medical aspects of our society, I think that our generation must be the one who will see the disappearance of major public heath issues such as viral hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus or cancers.

Then, the market was fierce and the costs were going down and down. The compagny decided to go out and replace employees by industrial innovation in the low cost country. The employee moral was to bad and the boss WAS changed. The new boss figure out a solution. every imcompetent people were job cuts and the more ambitious and motivated kept into the compagny.

      In my country the violence in the TV is ever-present. There are a lot of american TV show with a murder and children can see this every time. There are some documentaries but they are too complicated for a young people. In my opinion, we have to modify the hours to braodcast this program. Moreover, I think there are so many ads between two program and inside the program. These ads take often people for idiots. For my it is important to modify these ads because it is dangerous for young people the same level as TV show.

      Dear Dr Fenkil, I am writing in response to your online ad published on the web page of the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography for a post-doctoral position in phytoplankton physiology. During my PhD, I have worked on dynamics and controls of phytoplankton photosynthesis in the Strait of Dover (France). Consequently, I have a wide knowledge of phytoplankton ecology and physiology. Thanks to my previous research works, I have acquired several technical skills. I have used the PAM fluorometry to assess the phytoplankton photosynthetic performances and the spectral fluorometer &quot;FluoroProbe&quot; to characterize phytoplankton assemblages. I have performed nutrient analyses using an Alliance Integral Futura Autoanalyser II and I have made measurements of phytoplankton chl a-specific absorption coefficient by spectrophotometry. I have also analysed big data sets using univariate and multivariate statistical analyses. Finally, I have learned to use the software Matlab for fitting my light response curves. I would be glad to fully deploying my different skills to complete research projects with your team. I have attached my resume and contact information for 3 references. You can reach me anytime at +## # ## ## ## ##. Do not hesitate to contact me for any further information.%% I look forward to hearing from you and I thank you for your consideration.

      If the words &quot;new technologies&quot; mean &quot;new technologies of communication&quot;, then no new technology has particularly changed my life. I think that all technologies can change habits or provide new opportunities which help us in our lives. I mean that Tablets or Smartphones don't change our lives more than other technologies such as surgical technologies. For example, nowadays, it's possible to put a prosthesis to replace a leg! Thus a person who was sitting in his wheelchair, can walk after the prostheses were set up. With his prostheses, this person lost his handicap an can integrate a normal life. This progress changed obviously his life.

      This graph shows the fluctuation of national and  international sales figures for Best Books Company within a four-year period (2004-2008). The two overall trends have been at first quite similar with a sharp rise. Then, while national sales figures have been kept dramatically soaring, international sales figures have gradually decreased. Indeed, international sales have faced a sharp fall in 2005  from almost 2 million to 1 million.Then they have remained steady despite a slight drop in 2007. Meanwhile national sales have skyrocked from 2005 to 2007. Sales have reached its peak level at 3 million in 2007 . However sales have suddenly decreased in 2007 and have slightly felt ever since. Although national sales have strongly fallen, its figure has remainded twice higher than international sales figures in 2008.

      The year 2006 has been decisive for Best Books Company's national sales. Since that period, the national sales figures have been higher than the ones of international sales. Between 2005 and 2006, the international sales have first known a peak and then have fallen dramatically. So far, they haven't managed to go back to the leading level they had reached during the period between 2004 and late 2006 when they were taking over 2 millions while the national figures were hardly levelling at 1 million. Later, during the first term of 2007, it is interesting to see how the national sales figures have dramatically increased, almost reaching 3 millions, precisely at the moment when the international figures were collapsing under the half-million mark. Since that moment, both international and national figures have remained steady.

      I have been asked about etiquette pointers and how you are expected to behave when you are in France. It is considered good manners to take along a gift if you are invited to someone's home such as a bottle of wine. Typically, you are supposed to arrive a few minutes later. It is pretty rude to slurp or to eat with your fingers at a dinner table. You must not smoke inside a house unless your host allow you to do. Furthermore, you are expected to not cut in line when you wait for movie tickets for instance. It is really offensive even though a lot of people behave like that nowadays.

      Given that, I am still a student I will discuss about office politics in school. To my mind, office politics are not really used in University, we do not really see students using different tactics to be successful. Everything is based on talent and the amount of work you intent to dedicate in order to be at the top of your class. By contrast, I think in high school students were using more spin tactics in the aim to be popular or be elected as a class representative. I guess some people just master these tactics since a long time, in order to obtain what they desire. As regards my thinking of office politics, I think that to employ successful strategies you need to be very smart and not show your game like in a poker game. The bedrock of office politics lie on the ability to master the environment and the people surrounding yourself without appearing too ambitious and selfish.

      Darling, At the moment I'm thinking about my professional development and also my future in general. I realize I am very interested by my studies and I would like to learn even more by travelling around the world. That's why I was applying for an erasmus exchange for the Oslo University.  If I was accepted, I know it would be difficult for us because we would be far. I didn't reflect to a solution but I'm convinced it's possible. I'm looking forward to seeing you again.

      My life right now isn't really hectic. I live from paycheck to paycheck - when I can get one - and I'm often worried about my money. I can say I have a certain amount of stress. The thing is I've finished studies two years ago, and I couldn't start the job of my life yet. Although I can do whatever I want, go wherever I want to go and have a social life, it is not easy. I would like to be able to get my dream job, then to settle down. Once I do that, I could definitely start my lilfe. I'm still young, by the way I'm not really worried about my future. I know if I really want something to do of my life I'll do it, even if it takes more time than I expected. I won't stand the fact I let my chance passed in front of me without doing anything to take it. That's the worst thing I could do.

      Hello Michael, I'd like to update you on Neptune's project I'm currently working on. According to our progress, we will achieve the Feb, 5th deadline. Nevertheless, regarding our budget, we will exceed the plan by 10%. Primary cause is our lack of skilled people. I took decision to take temporary workers. It was crucial to hit the dealine. I reflected on the financial situation and came to the conclusion that we should meet our client. This customer added some new requirements which have not been budgeted at the beginning of the project. By having a face to face meeting with them, we will better explain overall situation and ask our respective team leaders from each department such as Engineering, Quality, Sourcing to get involved in that final negotiation. I've already asked them to get prepared and come with a power-point presentation that should be concise and effective to better convice our interlocutors.

      For any area and moment in the life the technology takes an important place. For my studies and my work the computer is something that couldn't be replaced. I guess that it's very confortable as you can be connected with all your friends. Since I've had my first cell phone, a small foldable panasonic, I can imagine my life without mobile anymore. In addition, the technology innovation today, such as smartphones, connexion of 4G, allows us to have acces from anywhere whenever we want. I mostly appreciate it because I can speak and see my family who lives in 4000 km from me via skype and that I can make they visit my new life and new town. My mother could be present in our marriage in the town hall on skype, because they couldn't come and assist here. So I think that we have a great opportunity today to have all this innovation.

      In France, we have a lot of musical comedies and plays in each city. Musical comedies take place all over the country, as a tour in the biggest towns. My family loves to see these shows. We love the way the production is implemented, and all of the details they had to think of. The costumes are absolutely exquisites, the dancing and the play of the characters are marvellous as well. We love to take part of the adventure they share with this kind of show. On the other hand, most of the plays talk about society aspects or social behaviours, in a humoristic context. If you want to see a play, you have to be prepared to laugh during all the show. It's amazing how the characters make fun about a society or social subject just by their play. I think all these shows are some interesting activities to do to have fun and share good moments with friends, and family. We used to first think of the cinema or the bowling, but we don't have to forget the others events our city can bring us.

I think we work more or less as long as everybody but without exhaustation because we can work at home or we can get out to make some exercise during the day ! Because lack of exercise is not a not good , you are not productive and it can lead to insomnia or depression ! We have an intelligent way of working and there's no distress at all !!

      I just heard the song &quot;Home Improvement&quot; by Josh Woodward who is a live-wire acoustic rock musician from Ohio. This song has an incredibly catching melody. This is a type of music that I am addicted to. The singer's voice is really edgy and the lyrics are not offensive at all but rather sentimental and sad. Because of the quick beat, you really want to dance to it and hit the notes with the singer. Now I can't get it out of my head !! Anyway, you should listen to it because the tune is pretty catchy. I promise, you will have a great time.

      We arrived at Bourbon Island airport half a day later than scheduled. We had booked a night flight but due to a malfunction of the pilot seat, the depart was postponed and we travelled during the day. The voyage was pleasant except for the low temperature in the cabin. The stewart didn't succeed in increasing it, so we spent 10 hours with blankets wrapping our bodies to keep us warm. Outside the airport, the temperature was scorching so we were covered with sweat in a minute. Fortuntely, the hotel has a swimming pool and we use it a lot.

One of my favorite outfits is some cool, old jeans with a thin, green, cotton T-shirt. I like to wear it with my new, blue tennis shoes. In the winter, I like to put on a big, black, polyester jacket. It's not natural fabric, but it's incredibly warm.

      About future... Firstly, I would like to say, usually, I am a very optimistic person.  But currently, I am worried because there are more and more differences between weather and seasons. So I think the pollution is more and more stronger. It's not encouraging for our health. Secondtly, I am nervous about unemployment which increases every day. We have got less and less manufactures and industries. Construction doesn't build like few years ago, so I am afraid of the future for my children and my family. I hope governments will make some actions and laws to decrease pollution and increase work. Finally, unless things seem difficult, I'll be sure that everyone must participate for the environment and crerated work values.

      I believe that the future will not be better or worth than now. In my opinion, I don't have optimistic or pessimistic view of the future. There will be more technologies for helping us working. People will be able to deal with these technology, and probably work less harder. However, the effective innovation will have also impacts on our health and our lives. There is no only a bright side of the progress. That is to say that the problems linked with the advanced technologies will be probably harder to solve and they will need people high educated. That's why poor people, or less educated will have more difficulties to find a job.

I hope you're going to follow his advisable evidence. All my sympathetic support to you. Christophe.

      In the future there will be a huge technologic market in Africa because many countries of this continent form part of the developing world, so the economy of those territories will certainly improve. By the way some people will be able to buy phones and computers, so that they will be able to acces medical information and culture from home. In Europe the sales will decrease because of the economic crisis. But in an environmental point of vue, if everybody use as much energy as expected, it will be terrible for the water and air quality...

      In France, they are lot of good manners. For example, when I meet for the first time someone, I dont use the first name. I say Mister or Miss Wirth and not Valrie for example. When I talk, I dont use the you like in English. In French we have a special personal pronouns: Its the  vous . I talk with the vous until the person give me the authorization to say tu (in English you).  Another example is when Im invited, I will arrive 5 minutes later but for a meeting Im always 5 minutes before. When I eat, I dont make noise and I dont cut a speech when someone talks. I think that the rules and behave are very important.

      It was a sunny day and Meg was going at work like every day. On her way, as she was approching the corner at Elm and Fourth, she saw a couple get out of a car and that were vandalising the area. Meg as a good citizen decided to try to stop them. But the woman waved a gun and began threatening Meg. The woman stole the laptop of Meg and then ran off down the street. Fortunately a guy chased her and caught her by the hair. Her hair has turned out to be a wig and it was not a woman but a teenage boy. Totally terrifying!

      Good morning,I am glad to learn that my demand has been accepted.I want to study on line because I live often in Paris and often in Burgundy near Auxerre and Chablis. I can't go to a school near home. It's more easy to learn on line.I don't have a particular subject to study. What I would like ,it's to be able to understand when somebody speaks to me english and to be able to speak more fluently english.The words, when I have to swpeak english, vanish. I miss automatism and habit. From time to time, the day along,I try to translate in english the sentences that I have just saying or when somebody has just speaking to me. But I have'nt  always a dictionnary near me.I shall try to learn with more regularity and know two days before to reserve a particular lesson.I hope that my resolutions keep a long time. Sincerely.

      Concerning the sales figures of the&quot;Manbag&quot;in Asia and South America. Here are the results of the surveys you requested, conducted in Rio de Janeiro and Shanghai. Introduction: The report was requested to compare sales figures market research. Methodology: Sample number were taken for covering all the demographics. 1000 people were interviewed in the both places. Findings: Rio de Janeiro 35% of people approve and 20% would buy 65% not approve. Shanghai: 80% of people approve and 40% would buy (20% not approve) Regarding the disapproval it is not a &quot;must buy&quot; idem due to several factors: Design, size, color, material Regarding the approval who would buy without great enthusiasm though it was &quot;ok&quot; nevertheless they expressed satisfaction. Conclusions: not enough market research were carried out before launching. The general opinion was a good idea but bad execution. The general feeling was that no recognition of the diversity of styles Quote: going global does not mean we are all the same you know. Recommendations: 1. More research: what men want and need in an accessory. 2. Design: more sporty Size: slightly bigger Colors: strong primary colors; black and white Material: leather 3. Changes also acceptable for Asia market as research shows current design is acceptable but not a lot of enthusiasm shown.%%

      As a lot of country, some behaviours are very bad in public, people could be offended by that : picking your nose, spitting, slurping... For greeting you must know some little things : if it is someone who you don't know, you must shake hands each other. If you know a woman and if you are familiar enough with her, you can kiss her. If it is a familiar man, it depends on the professional social environment. In fashion or show business environment, men who know each other kiss each other. Moreover don't be surprised if men who have grown together or are relatives kiss each other. More, the number of kisses depend on the region. It is between one to four!

But I regret there wasn't any bread on the table during the meal to appreciate the differents sauces (onion, garlic and curry). The free minth tea at the end of the dinner was a lovely idea.

      I am here to help everyone to get to its aim, give everybody a chance to succeed by bringing a human and financial support by raising funds and solidarity. If you vote for me, you will also have new desks and chairs and redecorated classrooms to work in an optimized atmosphere, I will also get teachers to spare some time to be able to listen to your various problems, college concerns or social bad feelings or other material discomfort, well any of the concerns you might have to face. I think you already have many reasons to make up your mind and elect me, but there is probably one other good motivating reason which is the one of creating a website dedicated to summer jobs : students and employers could meet there and find both their advantage by finding a job or a holiday employee, and make straight agreement on work conditions on that site so that everybody saves time and optimizes its chances. Now be assured that I count on you for coming up to vote and decide to move things towards a better college life. Thanks to you all for trusting me

      To spend time with my children is the most important in my life. I also need an interesting job. But, it's not always easy to combinate an exciting job with a family life. For example, I work in a company that doesn't propose a flexible timetable. I am supposed to work from 9 am to 6 pm. It would be that easier if I could sometimes start work at 7.30 am in order to finish at 4.30 pm. I could have time to do my work and would be available to take my children after school. It's why I decided to change job and looking for a new challenge in a company that is concerned with his employees' constraints. I think every day we have to think about what is the most important in our life, in order, not to have regrets in the future. I took a parental leave of six months after my maternity leave in order to spend time with my child and I will never regret this choice: babies grow so fast!

      I have a really good life. I'm a science instructor at a state university . and my husband and I own a new comfortable house . My parent live nearby . so i get to spend time with them. I have a certain amount of stress from work . although  i do take summers of. As far as money goes. I occasionally get a little nervous because our house payments are quite high. Fortunately , we don't have to live from paycheck to paycheck. The fact is we've got everything we need and more. However, sometimes I feel that something is missing . You see, my husband and I don't have kids. As the result , I get lonely . Last year, I thougtht long and hard about whether I wanted to adopt a child . I even called an adoption agency. In the end , I decide I was just having a mid life crisis . Life isn't prefect but everyone will have to accept that . And i'm trying to learn to enjoy the good things i had while i try to accept the hard things I don't have .

      Dir Sir, I would like to buy the flat I am currently living in and I am writing about the possibility to request a loan. Indeed I think there are many advantages, the most important is that it will be cheaper to buy than to rent in the long run. The property builds equity and in my opinion this is very important for the sense of stability. Moreover, this is a good way not to be dependent on a landlord, and to be free to change decor for example. My finances should allow me to buy the flat because I have an adequate income to pay the mortgage payments. You can also see in my budget outline that I have actually a rent which is probably the same amount as my future mortgage payments. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need more information. Yours sincerely.

      Dear Janice,  I am writing to you to say how terribly sorry I am for what happened at the dinner last night. I definitely didn't mean to offend you by bringing Selma as a guest. I am taking full responsability of Selma's behaviour. It was awfully rude and insensitive to keep asking questions about money notwithstanding how embarrassed you were. In fact, I don't even understand how she didn't notice that her attitude was way out of line and that she overstepped the mark. Although I am not looking to give excuses, I want to explain the reasons why she put her foot in it. She is coming from a very different culture in which money is not a taboo topic. Indeed, in her country, people are very comfortable speaking about money and salary.  I promise she will never speak out of turn again.  Once again please accept my apologies.%% Kind regards Pierre

      Mark an area of about 8 meters x by 3 meters as the bowling alley. Ten plastic bottles can be sused as the bowling pins - they  should be filled with a little water to make them heavier. Line up the bottle  in rows of 4, then 3, then 2,  then1. Just like ten pin bowling.Give each player a frisbee and take two shots on each turn. Give the players a total of ten turns each. One poiint is scored for each pin that  knock  down, then the player takes two more shots and all the points are added together. The winner is the player with the most points. Good luck!

The singer, Josh Woodward, hits some really appropiate notes. They make the song really catchy . The melody' s song makes me feel happy. I listenined to it twice. You can really dance on it and the sound is pleasant. The lyrics are a kind of humouristic and sentimental because the singer talks about his home and changement.

I think that the lyrics are sad and sentimental. As I know you like political songs , I recommend this music when you wante a beat and some politics in one song.

      In my last job, I was supposed to take the lead in negotiations for the purchase of my office furnitures. First I made a plan of what I wanted in the office: desks, chairs and some cupboards to put the files in. Secondly, I met several suppliers and asked them for a preliminary offer, after that, I selected the two best offers to follow the negotiations. The total was more or least  4 500 and it was out of my budget that my boss had given to me. Then I asked them for more informations on the quality, the place where it was built, the different colours they proposed, and the service plan. By the time I explained I was afraid that I couldnt go that high and that I was expected a discount. To clarify, I told them that, as we had already bought a large number of desks and cupboards,  my boss wouldnt accept the purchase without a good bulk discount. They gave me all the informations needed and they both proposed an interesting discount. But my boss didnt confirm the offers and told them directly that over the next year we would open a second office in another city and we would need other furnitures.%% Finally, they proposed a discount and one of them proposed a material from another manufacturer with a similar quality but at a lower price, it was also a two-year service plan that covers parts and labor. The total was  3 000, I was happy for these negociations but I couldnt decide on my own. Obviously, I took time to review and check with my boss. Finally He accepted and signed the contract.

      In France, the 20th century was an improvement according to the women place in the society. Before the Second World War, the role of women was to stay at home, to take care of childrens and to educate them. But during the war, women invested in factories to replace men. The war as been a rotative for women. In fact, the place according to women has increase. They obtain the right to vote, to right to work without the agreement of their husband... Gradually, they have a most important place in the society and mainly in the world of work where we can see more and more women as CEO or with an important place. However, there is still not equality between men and women. For exemple, the women's wage is often lower than the men's one. And theyis still inequality in politic where the place of women is still not important even if they represent the majority of the population. But we can says that the french society has made huge progress during the last century.

Afterwards, I decided to start my studies in pharmacy and I did well with success. During my studies, I made a lot of trades for pay them. Subsequently, when I had been starting to have enough studies years, I could start to make internship in industries of pharmacy. I started with an long internship in quality assurance department, so I have a solid background in this sector. Following that, I made an internship in regulatory service in another company. This was a short internship, so I don't have an extensive experience in regulatory if I may say so. Currently, I am making a internship again, in a quality assurance departement. I am quite smart, ambitious and determined on what I do, whithout claim. My biggest regret in my life still my medicine studies taht I failed. I wish I'd success them. May I should work more ? I suppose I'll continue my career in quality assurance estate. Ideally, I would become an expert in this domain. Apparently, I won't have any difficulty because I love that.

      I would like to clarify and review the results of the negociations. We need to buy 50 lightweight and tough laptops computer. The preliminary offer was 900  per unit. After lots of discussions with the vendor, he has confirmed that his company can deliver it at 820 per unit. To be more specific, the total purchase price is 41000  intead of 45000  initially. It's a very good price for us. Delivery would be over the next two months. In the contract, we also have a standard service plan for two years, but we have decided to pay an extra 40 per unit, to make that a three-year service plan. It covers all the damages, all the parts and the labor. The last step is to send them the signed contract.

According to my lawyer, my contract clearly states that I should be compensated for weekend work. Furthermore, I would be pleased if you would not take the moral high ground: nothing in the contract allows you to refuse to pay me for a business that is not your fault. As a result, I demand you to pay me for the work I have done these two weekends. Moreover, I warn you with regrets that, if you proceed with denial, I will sue you for damages.

      I decided to learn English when I became aware that it was tremendously important for business and travel. So, since a few years, I tried to study English by myself but It was difficult for me to be self-motivated. Plus, I had no opportunities to talk with others English speaking people. Fortunately, last year one friend of mine recommended me to enrol in online language training like Englishtown. According to him, this online platform was going to allow me to improve my English skills more easily and more efficiently. At first, I didn't believe him. But, finally I dared to overcome my misgivings. It has been convenient for me to follow my courses whenever I have wanted and from anywhere. Now, I realize that English has improved my life by allowing me to meet other English speakers from all over the world and communicate with them. Even though the learning process has frequently been frustrating and painful, I'm proud of the progress I've made.

      Do you know the last song of Josh Woodward, called &quot;Home improvement&quot;? I just listened to it. I did not know the singer, but he has a nice warm voice. At the beginning, he is staying in kind of low notes, but after a while, he hits higher notes. But his range is rather limited anyway. I love that kind of voice, but i must say that I was mostly catched by the beat, which is continuous all along the song. You can really dance on it. It is definitely a rock beat, but the mood of the song is quite country. Since your girlfriend loves dancing rock, you will both love it, I'm sure!

For the dessert, my wife was chosen a home's raspberry pie and Profiteroles for Me, all washed down with a bottle of St Emilion mountain 2004. The addition was light. I'll recommend this restaurant to my friends and my family.

      Last year, there was a murder. A guy raped and killed eight girl in my neighbourhood. Specially near my University. My University's director said we must be very careful and at this time of the year, all students were very afraid. The police never say if they found the criminal but we never heard about him since many month. So everyone thinks that the outlaw is in jail but there is no proof ...

      The &quot;Palais Bahia&quot; is my favourite restaurant. They serve authentic morroco food. My favourite main course is called &quot;Couscous&quot;, a north african specialty. It's based on cereal semolina. You can order a chicken couscous, but the baked leg of lamp couscous is fantastic.It' also served with some vegetables, like carrot, turnip and others, cooked in a spicy sauce. There're also chickpea. Due to this generous entree, you don't need to order a appetizers.

And it taught me that life depends on a thread and that life can change at any time. Best regards, Vivi

      David has good decision-making skills, when he is under pressure. Often he puts off passing key information to co-workers or keeping up with paperwork. He has the ability to work in a team but it seems like he have fallen out with one or two of his team members since the exhibition. Not always good at listening to other people's ideas, but he has lots of creative ideas himself. I'm not sure if we'll regret promoting him so soon. But its awesome to have David as my supervisor. He's so interested in IT.He's searching on the internet, always wanting to find some new stuff for his computer and he also showed me some social networking sides. David's very fun to go on the road with on overseas trips, I must say. He can get pretty competitive when we're doing joint presentations to clients, and he's been a bit aggressive with me when I've suggested doing things more &quot;by the book.&quot; He's good at solving problems on his own, though he occasionally takes the credit for other people's ideas. I haven't brought this up with him myself yet, but sometimes he's a bit unreliable - turning up late to exhibitions, forgetting to email clients with project updates. So I don't feel I can always count on him. David's been an invaluable member of our soccer team since March 2008. He trains hard and handles feedback well - this is very professional. Especially since he's helped us win the interdepartmental trophy twice now. That was awesome! In large part this is due to his speed and ability to run the length of the pitch without passing the ball to anyone so he can score another goal! He's possibly the fastest one of the fastest player I've ever seen. I think the soccer brings out his aggressive side, especially when he's challenged for the ball, and I heard this shows up in the office, too.

      The two lessons, I have learned about life are, we wasted time when we were young, find a job you love. It's sure that the family is here around you, it's sure it's a great thing for you, it's sure you have to consecrate time for them, but to head you up you must be attract in new thing in the world, you must be curious. What I want is to meet a lot of great people with experinecing background to talk with them, to exchange ideas about a lot of things. What I want is also keeping a good health and know what to do to improve it. If I choose my food before to have a meal, it's because I don't want eat insane or chemical food. It's a captivating time to try to find new food and new recipes to cook. To be happy in the life, you have to be an &quot;epicurien&quot;. You have to avoid the maximum of suffers. Good hunt !!!

Finally this possibility to work off site was given to me because of technology. My company gave me a laptop and an internet connection. So now, I can organised my work as I want. For example, I don't like to get up early, so mainly I start to work at about nine o'clock in the morning. It's a very good thing and gives you a lot of liberty. The only thing is to be able to finish your duty on time. But it's also a double edge sword because you have to be very careful with your private life.

      I think the driving law about using phone while driving, is not so strict in Australia. It's just normal. In France this law exist but you can use your phone when stopped out of the road. The fine if you use a phone while driving is not so high and it's not so reprimended according to a lot of people. Maybe that's the reason why there're many accidents in french's road. People often break this regulation and don't affraid of the fine they could get. I think this law should be as strict as the Autralian's law. For people safety on the roads, the fine has to be more expensive than currently.

      In France, when you receive an invitation manners arequite similar that in England. In fact,it's important tothanks your host, to take a little present or thinks like that... In France, this kind or rules are mainly present in the bourgeois class where it's veryimportant to be different and to distinguish. And when it's some very close frend,this kind of manners aren't really important.

      Mark an area of 8 meters by 3 meters. Use ten plastic bottles filled with a little water to make them heavier. Line up the bottles in row of 4, then 3, then 2, then 1. Give a frisbee at each player allowed to take two shots on each turn in the limit of ten turns. Each pin that is knocked down scored one point. If all the bottles are knocked down, the player takes two more shots and all the points are added together. The player with the most points is the winner.

      Hi my name is vicky. I candidate for student council president. Let me just tell you a little bit of myself. I like to take care of other people, I believe we can make a change. I like to react and to improve things and I like to see people happy. We spend 60 percent of our daytime in school and this is the place where your future begins. I would like to convince the principal to invest in more field trips but we can also make a change. By raising a fund and taking part in national competitions we can collect money to provide more books for free for our students. By voluteering in the canteen we could reduce the prices for hot drinks. I will take my job seriously and I will listen to your fears and demands.

      Note to all executive people : Dear colleagues, I'm aware that we are all engaged in many projects. Because all those projects are running in parrallel, it creates a bottleneck in our ressources that finally impacts negativelly our results. Our company is expanding, going global and we need to improve our work processes. Therefore I'd like to toss around a few of my ideas. What if we decide to better follow our projects by having regular meetings with main stakeholders in projects ? I defintitely consider that better follow projects's results is a key element to be successful at the end. We could set-up regular one to one meetings with our respective actors in projects, organize be weekly meetings with complete team. Doing things this way will allow us to better tracks our projects, determine where we are good, what needs to be improved.  I think we have been experiencing too many communication issues. Therefore I consider that communication both individualy and with complete team is N' 1 thing in our strategy. Also we need to make sure that all our teams understood correctly their individual goals.  They all should commit on them in order to make them responsible.%% I hope we will all be on the same page regarding my today suggestions. Thank you !

The ingredients in this recipe was excellent, I could find kits that I knew not necessarily before. For my part I chose wine to accompany my wine, and I found it good.

      India is a great and beautiful country, with a lot of traditions. If you are invited to an Indian person's home, you have to know the correct etiquette. First of all, you should bring a small gift, in order to say thank you. If you come from a foreign country, it will be very appreciated to bring a gift from your country. For example, if you come from France, a bottle of wine or a perfume like &quot;Channel n'5&quot; will be very appreciated. Then it is strongly recommanded to wash your hands beore eating, because sometimes, in some areas of India, you are supposed to eat only with your right hand. Finally, don't forget to enjoy the cooking at the end of the dinner.

      In French cities, the buildings are a bit older than in other countries such as China or Duba. Firts, if you go to Paris, you will see a lot of old-fashion buildings downtown. They reflect the previous architectural French styles, such as Baroque or Renaissance. Buildings are not tall, and they are a lot of windows in each appartment. Then, if you go to the museums, you could have an idea about what France looks like in the past. The Louvre is a formal royal palace, and the Muse d'Orsay a former trainstation. Each of them have been refurbished to create a place where famous artists and exhibitions are host. I'd say that the most common line of the Parisians buildings are their windows, and their old-fashion look. Museums or houses are sometimes very similar, and it makes Paris as one of the most beautiful city in the world. A place where modern and old architecture can live together.

      Pascal is a very good salesman. He is the best one of the company. He always knows how presenting a complicated project in a easy one. He knows how to &quot;seduce&quot; a client (or our CEO) and how to adapt his behaviour to win. Everybody admire his comercial abilities and his cheek. But, as a colleague or as a boss, he is a nightmare. He can't stand playing collectively... and when you ask him some advices, he will not respond you. You can't rely on him. Never ready to help. He is always in a bad mood and criticizes everybody without any regrets. He feels superior to others and I can't stand such negative attitude.

You always receive this content by mail fewer hour before the courses. And after the courses you can receive the notes and the solutions of many exercices.

      When I was growing up, I read books printed on paper. I'd read anything- graphic novels; autobiographies; bike magazines; and my favourite, science fiction. Somewhere along the way, I've transitioned from paper to electronic media. In the early 2000s, I read my first e-book. It was a 1950s romantic:&quot;their Eyes were watching GOD,&quot; written by Zora Neale Hurston, written before digital communications media was even born. Now, I read my novels and news on a tablet. I do research for work on search engines, blogs, magazines and online dictionaries. I've noticed some huge diffrences in my habits, too. With paper media, I would use my fingers to turn a page; with electronic media, I tap or swipe my screen to go to the next page. Sometimes news articles contains links. I can tap the link and be taken to an entirely new world of information. In fact, I do a different finger dance made from a complex series of taps and swipes to accomplish certain goals. None of this was possible with paper books and, frankly, sometimes all this digital interaction can become a little distracting. In all, however, I enjoy it.

      I can hardly write about management strategies because in in real life, my work has absolutely nothing to do with management and I don't have a team to manage. But as we don't know what the future will be, maybe one day I'll be  a team manager. I think the first thing to do is of course to choose the members of your team with the skills you need and choose people with the willing to work in a team and not just alone. Not everybody is able to work in collaboration to solve one same task. Then identify clearly their goal, and give then the tools to accomplish it. For a better teamwork, you also need your team to get along, for example allowing them to know each other by making activities together. Why not going to drink a beer together after a hard day at work? With a good environment, your project has better chance to succeed.

The CEO proposed to replace the CFO in employing someone from outside, but the board of directors was not on the same page. They suggested taking an employee from inside the company. Concerning the second item, our human ressource executive proposed to offer some training to the staff and to review their salary in order to show them that the merger is good for them.

      If I speek about green business, for me it's the sale of products which are environment friendly. It also can be products which are produce in our area or country, not at the other end of the world. To be green I think the industrustry has to think about the packaging which often is too much for me. For example when I do my shopping , I always use a bag which I can be reutilised. I need my car to go to work every day but I try not to take it if not necessary. I also have a little garden where I plant  my own vegetables. I buy always tissurs which are recyclable. In my neighborhood many people have solar panel on their roofs; I taught to myself if I have to change my heating I'll also buy a green one which runs with air power and I'll put some solar panels on my roof too. I mean if a company built a new building, they also have to take care to utilise green material which are safer for our planet. My point is if everyone kate a little more care of what I buys and hopely what he puts in the rubish we can go ahead.%%

      Last month I decided to change the window of my bedroom. I contacted a craftsman who made a preliminary offer for 100. I anticipated that changing just one window would be expensive so i negociated with him. We met last week so as to clarify my need because I wanted to make sure we are both on the same page. He came home to make an inventory and he proposed me to change the four windows. My budget was not enough so as to pay 400 so I suggested him to make a discount. He checked with his manager and 4 days later he called me to confirm that his manager accepted 300 for the 4 windows. He starts tomorow.

      Mr Smith came to us to give  presentation about new solar products of that new brand. I liked the way he spoke during that presentation. His voice was strong enough to be heard by everybody in this large conference room, and he emphasized very well on key points. his eyes ran on the whole audience, making no one feeling left apart. He used some clear charts, that made us aware of his aims, even without being solar products specialists However, he could have brought some of those products, to make the audience more attentive, because he spoke during 3 hours, at least. At the end we were all not so careful to his points. Making his talk more concrete with products he was talking about could have given his presentation a much more living face. The projector was not working very well. Mr Smith could have checked it before his presentation began, it was difficult for rear seats to see clearly dark areas on the screen.

      c/o Sir Robert RighterDear Sir, I thank you for your email. Here is the reply about my education and my motivation.First of all, I studied english and german at High School. I graduated later as an Engineer. Since the end of my education I've sometimes been using german in my meetings but never english or badly, about several short sojourns in London.I'll move next year to another country for my job, and I want to study online because I am very busy and I've to do the best schedule I can of my each daytime. Also, I think your study program is the most flexible I meet to answer to my constraints.I must speak english fluently because I'll be serving a company which sits in Seatle, Washington DC. And in my business, there is a lot of bristih customers too that I'll have meeting.Finally, I'll be less fearling by your large experience, the renown and your attention even after I finished studying with your study program.Sincerly.

      In France, education is managed by the State. Most of the students goes to universities because they are quite free. There is no selection to apply, so Universities are crowded and it's hard to follow the courses especially the first year.  Since 1968, there has been a huge problem with authority and the level is getting down, year after year You can also apply for what we call &quot;Big schools&quot; which are close to your college. We've got some of the best of the world, for exemple HEC in commercial or Centrale in ingenieering. A drawback is that those schools are expensive, about 20keuros for a year. But after, you can find a job easyly. I strongly suggest you to chose one of those.

      The song &quot;Home Improvement&quot; by Josh Woodward has a good mood in spite of the content of the lyrics. I like the melody, but I think the beat is a little bit too swift . We can feel the sadness in the voice of the singer which suits with the content of this song. But he doesn't hit enough high notes which is a pity because I'm sure he has the range to do it. Someone who wants to discover folk-rock tune should listen to this song because it's a sample of what we can usually hear in this kind of music.

      'How to make a career out of courage' by Judith Wight has just been published. You wonder if you are happy at work? Have you already imagined to change work but unfortunately you don't really know how to do this? This book is probably for you.In this book, Judith Wight explains in the first part of her book that many people are suffering at work. It's very well documented with statistics. In the second part, she explores with you the reasons of your discontent. One time that the reasons are clear and the diagnosis has been done, she describes in the third part some keys in order to build your own personal project.The strength of her book is its optimism and everybody will be able to identify oneself. But probably, it's not so easy and some described situations could be interpret as utopist.

      To help me with vocabulary, I read books in English and write in a list the unknown words. Then I search the meaning of these words in the English-English dictionnary. By using this method I made a lot of progress. Sometimes I take four different newspapers and I read each article on the same subject. It helps me learn more about synonyms and antonyms. When I don't know the meaning of a word, I search in the context and the other words around if I could find a sense. I wish I knew more about compounds nouns beacause that's definetely my weakness.

      I have been living in several countries, every time the rules of etiquette aren't the same. In my native country&quot; France&quot;, if you are a guest and the host doesn't smoke, you must avoid to smoke inside a flat or a house. It's only possible when the host smokes and offers you a cigarette. But in Vietnam people doesn't care about smoking everywhere. In Vietnam young people are very respectful of the old people. Children daren't to speak badly to their grand parents and are careful about their wellbeing. But in Frence the youth can be rude with elder,we must always tell them not to sit down before and give your chair to old people. We can observe difference of etiquette. Nevertheless politeness is at first: to pay attention to other people and respect them. It's a basic goal of politeness which we can find all over the world.

      When I was younger, the most prominent media were: newspapers,radio and television. Now, I would say that it is has been a huge change in the way we are consuming media. Most people nowadays, especially teenagers are making use of internet to obtain the information they desire at the cost of television and radio. This evolution has been facilitated by the emergence of new technological devices such as: tablets,smartphones and laptops. To my mind, I believe that the change in the way media are using is mainly due to the fact that radio and television are becoming old-fashioned. Indeed on the internet you can choose what kind of information you intent to read or see and not just &quot;undergo&quot; the news like on television. Traditional media will need to adapt their tv shows if they do not want to lose viewers. An example could be the integration of tweets during their program in order to involve the viewer in the program show.

      Social networking sites are pretty good to meet new people, developp contacts and keep in touch with your friends. But there are lots of hazards about it. Indeed, you have to write some personnals informations and everyone can access to them, it's not safe about your life. Other dangers are the rumors, the ability to choose wether others can see that you've viewed their profile.

      I currently live in France. In this land, it is considered rude to spit in public, even though more and more young people tend to do it when they smoke or just by some kind of habit. It is also inappropriate to address elder people in an informal way when you don't know them. When elderly people seem to need help to carry stuff or walk, we are supposed to help them, at least a bit. When one enters in a public building like a shop or a restaurant, he is supposed to greet the workers by a simple 'Hello'. Unfortunately, young people are nowadays ruder and ruder and seem to purposely ignore manners.

      In my opinion, TV can help educate children. For example TV can show children animals, history or science, to develop their intelligence. Thus we need to show and choose the right channel with them. There's too much sexe and violence on TV. So we have to see the rating system, before allow our children to watch it. There are too many commercials also on TV in my country.Most of them shows 15 minutes an hour every 40 minutes. I feel strongly that TV should be educational not just entertaining or violent, because children are watching. We need to ask for more educational programs.

      I am not so much addict to technology since in my opinion, they are no advanteges to technology. in fact, technoloy can facilitate a lot the life but it also has a lot of downsides. For example, at work, we still have a desktop. In my opinion, if the company would decide to replace all desktops by laptops,I could have the opportunity to work in the train, during the travel from home to work. I could also work at home when one of my child is ill for example. But on another hand, O+I think I wouldn't have so much private family life if I could work at home with a laptop and an i-phone: my boss could call me at every time and I would be supposed to answer the phone.

      The two tests TOEIC and TOEFL were made for testing proficiency in English . This is the only similarity betwee them . While the TOEIC is used by companies to make decisions about recruiting and deploying employees overseas , the TOEFL is used by English language programs and schools as a placement test and as a measurement of readiness for academic programs .The TOEIC is taken by employees in international corporations and job applicants whereas the TOEFL is followed by students in college and universities who have a language requirement and applicants to scolarship and exchange programs .The skills tested are similar in the two tests .The test format is more developed in TOEIC than TOEFL while the duration of these tests are the same .According to the features of these tests and to my eligibility to a government sponsorship , the TOEIC would be the most appropriate formation for me because it tests English for work .

Sometimes he was kind, gentle and loving, and in the next minute he was turned on her, specially after drinking.She swears she didn't want to kill him, she just wanted he stops shouting.A neighbor has been an eyewitness. He was working at his computer last night, and from his window he saw Surina and Dave arguing about something in the kitchen. Suddenly he saw Surina pick up a knife and stabbed Dave into the chest. She seems to be in a fury. She acted like a crazy woman. It was really horrible. Dave was lying on the floor, bleeding.At the moment, Dave's mother was in the bathroom when she heard a scream and rushed into the kitchen. She saw her beloved son, dead in the floor in a pool of blood. She told the policeman Surina was manipulating and calculating, and she must spend the rest of her life in prison.

      The brain is a wonderful thing on condition that it's well used.On the other hand, a brain is a kind of sponge and the sponge absorbs less when you are not enough young to learn.

Sometimes, I make a bizarre image in itself, but that helps me to lodge a word in my memory.I also try to read books in English and watch English movies with subtitles as well.Nevertheless, I think it's never too late to learn, and I wish I could be fluent in English very soon, and I focus my attention on it for a few months.I can do it!

Most important, I will see if my english and my strong accent are a big problem for this medical career. Next, based on my professional english speaking capacities, I will decide if either I should try to apply to be a registered nurse or if I should change my career path. Then, if I decide to be a registered nurse, it will take me 2 years of hard studies and clinical experiences. After that, I will try to find a very good job.

      The office culture in the factory I work is rather formal. The main reason is: there is a large scale of ages, young employees wear cool clothes, jeans and T-shirts, they often meet after work, to have a drink or a dinner, to go to the cinema or other entertainment. The olders, with their white shirts and ties, are not the same cares and not the same problems than their colleagues so they don't met them after work time. But our Director, a young manager, takes care to balance the responsabilities between old and young, he knows how to use the good qualities of everyone without any idea of competition. He takes care to allow the vacation in rotation. So nobody is stressed and there is a good mood in the office.

      The Chess game is my favorite game. It is a smart game and of strategic. You can played it with a human partner or a computer. This game is played on a checkerboard composed of sixty-four spaces and thirty-two pieces, (king, queen, fools, towers  horses and other pawns). Blacks on one side, whites the other side. The blacks against whites. Each of these pawns moves differently. The purpose is to put king &quot;checkmate&quot;. This play can last a very long time.

      Ten years ago i have six channels on my tv. Today I have thirty channels. Do I watch more tv? No, because i don' like to spend time front of it. But if i watch tv i prefer movie, sports program, and information program. When I watch tv i was surprised at tv reality show were every where. I feels strongly that shows are stupid. We need to have more educational program or may be more channels of it. But i know tv reality show save a lot of money of the channel. Basically we have to pray that one day educational program become profitable

      I'm really a great fan of the Josh Woodward's song &quot;Home Improvement&quot;! I find that it is plenty of feelings.... I consider that the beats are really enjoying, too. The voice is good;  we can hear that the singer got totally his voice's variations under his control what means that he could be considered like a good singer. All the great songs aren't good to dance, but the beats being very good, we could  dance on this song. But, perhaps that actually the beats don't correspond exactly to the lyrics,  which is so a little bit romantic. Finally, it isn't my favorite song, but one of the best.

      Two years ago, I hearded about a tsunami near my to country. No warming was announced so people was not prepared for that. Suddently people on the beach saw a big couch of water and start running to the ground. Unfortunately there were a lot of people in the sea and most of tehm were killed during the disaster. People who lives near the beach call the police. Police arrives quickly and then a lot of trucks of firefighters and the military also come. They try to evacuate people from there but water grew quickly and some people died. It was terrible.

      Report about the survey First I would to state with some hundred and twenty person (represented ten per cent of employees) the survey is significant. Most people were unhappy with the management of the overtime. We have a problem with the extra hours. For the employees the delay, two years, to be eligible for the advantage package is too long. I propose a delay of eighteen month and that could be more reasonable. The employees didn't have enough feedback about their performance. We could perhaps make weekly meeting feedback to organize that. The lines reporting is too long as take a decision. We must think about the structure of the company. I propose to plan a meeting around these questions. Best Regards. Bob

      Because of our results economics, we need cut costs for exit the crisis . I have two proposals, first, don't hiring news persons as provided and delay the new car project in three months. This action make economize 1,5 million dollars and of no have what make layoffs persons of our team. Second, the costs of rent office have also risen 20 percent this year. We should find and rent new offices with costs less of rentals for month. With these decisions we will exit this crisis and recover cash for advance of our initial project without need layoff of staff.

Even though we haven't lacked food on the table and still had a roof over our heads, we couldn't save money into a saving account. But now things are turning around, we going to move into our new appartment next month and my salary will increase too. So we will able to pay off our debts.

      Gender equality in France: a goal to be achieved by designing policies? Gender differences in politics still remain an ongoing issue in France.  In 2000, legislation was passed that stated an equal number of women and men candidates should be on political partys lists. The legislation was brought up on how France was ranked at the bottom of all European countries for the percentage of women it had in politics; just 10%. More than 25% of jobs available that are taken by French women are only part time. In a couple, women often take care of the day-to-day work as well as caring after the children which is considered less valued than what men do. Social inequalities of life expectancy are stable among women but are increasing more among men. This is mostly due to the history of the country and culture.

Have you ever heard about the Sec Discrimination Act ? According to you, what do you need to be sure your complaint will be lawful and take into account by the legal authorities ? How will you proceed to gather any clues of discrimination ? Do you think people who lodge an accusation for discrimination against one of their colleague, may be demoted then ?

      In France, like in numerous other countries, the punishment for a crime is linked with the &quot;degree&quot; of the crime. A thing which is criticised around here is that perpetuity  doesn't really exist, like in the USA, where you can be convicted for more years of prison than your entire lifetime (and that is also kind of ridiculous - why just don't say people are convicted until their death instead of 150 years, for instance ?) Well, I said that perpetuity doesn't exist in France : that's true. The french &quot;perpetuity&quot; is &quot;just&quot; thirty years, at the maximum. This is called a &quot;safety sentence&quot;. I don't know very much the French system -even if I'm french-, but I guess some people are in jail for their entire lifetime. The problem is : some dangerous killers are released after thirty years, and even if prison changes a man -in better or worse-, only God knows what he is up to when he goes back to the outside...

      Compared to other countries, France has always been rather late in adopting gender equality. This is mostly due to the history of the country and culture. Inequalities are both at work and at home. Indeed, on average, women spend almost 3 and a half hours doing housework whereas men only spend 2 hours dusting, cleaning, ironing etc... In a couple, women often take care of the day-to-day work as well as caring after the children which is considered less valued than men do. Furthermore, men earned more than women, and more than than 25% of jobs taken by French women are only part time. There are some women in business and politics but they have not the same privileges. Gender disparities remain persistant in France. On the other hand some progress have been made over the past years. Who knows? Maybe someday we'll have gender equality.

In the evening, we will go to the party or why not still on the beach. See you soon

      Dear Sir,I am writing to ask your advice about a problem I have with my real estate agent.Until recently, I have been living in a house at # Hunter Street but now that I have left this home, the real estate agent refuses to give me my deposit back because of many malfunctions.When I signed the contract, these problems were already present. The landlord promised to have them fixed. Unfortunately I have lived there without his intervention, with lights that do not work in many rooms, with clogged drains and a leaking roof!I would to like to know if I am entitled to receive that money and if you could help me to recover it?Yours faithfullyMr Barbasso

At 7 p.m. I was checked in at the hotel, taked my room and beginned my visit around London.

      I'm living in France. Here, according to me, etiquette and good behavior are usual in comparison with the others European Countries. To say hello, you are giving both kiss on the one cheek. Usually when you're outside in public, you should be polite and use good manners. For example, on the bus, you should let old people, or pregnant women sit down if all sittings are full. Or if you're watching a film into a cinema, you should be quiet and don't speak. If you're going to someone house, you should, like in England, arrive a little bit late. You can bring gift but isn't always necessary. In France, speaking loud is considered be rude, you should speak loud only if you're unhappy with someone.

We are three persons in the office and we have good relations between us. Many of my colleagues have a coffee before beginning the work but not me. I work as soon as I'm arrived. I hate coffee. And too many colleagues spend their time to gossip and I can't bear these attitudes. I always see the same colleagues working in the corridors with one paper in their hands just to spend the day to speak but not to do their work. I prefer staying in my office even I have no work.

Consumers in Rio de Janeiro and in Shangai were interviewed and asked to evaluate the difference of sales in Asia and South America. Findings : 80% of interviewed in Shangai (1000) are favorable to the design of our Manbag but only 55% of us can buy it in the future. In Rio de Janeiro, only 35% responded favorably to the design and 20% can by it. Not enough market research carried out before the surveys. General feeling is that no recognition of the diversity of styles and tastes in different parts of the world has been shown: Recommandations : More research Rethinking the design

      In France, personnal space isn't really a problem. We aren't also close than people in the Middle East but the contact isn't a matter. For example, when we are on a social occasion and we know nobody, it is expected people to shake hands to say &quot;hello&quot; and start a conversation. But if you know someone, even just a little bit, you can kiss on the cheek. Then, during a conversation, it's appropriate to be modest. French people can't stand boastful people. Indeed, if you are interesting, people will give you the occasion to talk about you. French people works out a lot with implied. They like you are able to guess what they want but it's just bonus, not a requirement. Finally, at a dinner party, the host is the chef of the party. So, it's impolite to sit down, start eating or drinking before the host invited you to do it. Oh, and a little gift like a bottle of wine for the men and a bouquet of flowers for the women would be much appreciated.

      In the part France where I stay, disasters are very rare. In others places, they can have flood or wildfire. In the mountains near me there is sometimes a large avalanche which damage a lot. But in summer, we have a lot of storms, with thunderbolts and a lot of rain. Once, more than twenty years ago, it was a big one. And there was a plug in a small river in the mountains. The water couldn't flow down. Then, there was plenty of water and suddenly the water run down. So the river in a few seconds became very high. A lot of cars, caravans, houses were carry away, many persons were killed.

      I attended a meeting the previous week. The points on the agenda were to talk about a possible merger of the company with one another, which was in another town. The CEO started by saying we should arrange a meeting with the board of our partners, in order to discuss about changes and such subjects. The CFO disagreed and suggested we should see with our executives the exact situation of our budget before. The COO argued we were running out of time, so it wasn't possible.They finally agree to arrange a meeting this week.

      I recently went to a fish restaurant. They serve full range of fish with differents kinds of dressings. I took grilled fish with baked potatoe and it came with salad and for the apetizer I have mushroom soup. As desert I has a delicious cheese cake. The salad was well dressed and I have a lot of shrimps inside. I know it was a lot of seafood but is healthy. My friend was very happy because of the good taste of food. She had baked fish with french fries and it comes with zucchinis. Not so healthy but tasty. We'll probably go there.

      I just heard the new song, 'Home Improvement,' by The Josh Woodward. It's a rock tune and the electric guitare driving me crazy. But i think ,this music is a little bit annoying.The singer,Josh Woodward , hits some really low notes and Josh 's voice is rough and edgy.There's not much of a change in mood and i also think it's really difficult to dance to 'Home Improvement' because there isn't much of a beat.At last , i think ,this song is not original because i have the feelings that all rock singers have the same melody.

      I feel strongly that there are too many series on TV in my country. For example, every night one detective series program. It is always the same, no diversity. In my opinion, those are the only program that should interest people. If at least they put several episodes in a row. They put a new episode and after the former, users still looks the same things without realizing it. All series are american. We need to ask for more restrictions on them.

You are afraid of crowded confined spaces. So I understand that our new office location makes you not feel comfortable because you have to take the subway and your workspace  is now smaller. But there are solutions to get rid off your phobia! Your felling of anxiety, your breathing problems when you have to move in the office corridors can disappear completely! Ive heard of a new technique which name is cognitive Behavioural Therapy . The technique enables you to get used to confined spaces by small steps with a therapist who will use meditation, breathing techniques and other methods. I am confident that you will overcome your fear. Why dont you give  a try before resigning?See you soon,Emeline

We spend time together after work at midday and after 7 pm . We exercise every day and we stay motivated all the year. Either we do a workout at the gym or we go jogging on the beach. This lifestyle at work is a good way to reduce your stress and encourage the development of solidarity and mutual aid. We work 45 hours or so a week on average. We go out with friends to dinner, for a drink or to the cinema every week. I try to maintain a healthy work-life balance and to stay relaxed.

To start, I'd like to tell you that there love story is a youthful romance. While they still were students they already shared a common interest which is a passion for song and music. To pursue their higher education, they often had to be far from one another for long periods of time. But never has time or distance altered their relationship. Their patience and desire to well organize such an event is a good indication of their respect for marriage. Hugh and Samuella, I believe that your couple will be a source of inspiration for family, friends and colleagues. I wish you to have as many children as you want and to be successful in your assignments for the generation we're living in. Could we please all stand up and raise our glasses to Hugh and Samuella!

In a world where people are effrayed by microbs, it is very important to immunise our system. So, for the immune system, the great solution is garlic crushed with lemon and acerola. Finally, ginger and raspberry leaf, chewed or in a tea, will help any kind of nausea. People who suffer from travel sickness or morning sickness for instance but who don't want  take any antibiotics or aspirins will like this home remedy.

The point is that his team feels understaffed and overworked and isn't able the keep its efficiency with its feeling underappreciated at the time.Being considering that, I do think we need to offer them some incentives, whichever they could be, to re-motivate his team as soon as possible by offering them overtime and bonuses, and at last recruit to the team to keep on meeting the deadlines for our precious projects.I would like you to address me your issues before it is too late, I mean before this situation deteriorates more and spread to other teams of our trustful and respected company.I am looking forward to receiving your best consideration for this problem.Best regards.John.

The actors are amazing, the plot is incredible with a lot of suspense and suddenly revived. Let me present the begging of the story : the king dead and his son was a bastard, a lot of chief would fought the new king and took the thrones. It's a simple description of the movie but the heart of the intrigue. I think you don't know the actors, It isn't popular, our manes are Emilia Clark, Peter Dinklage (it's a dwarf), Sean Bean ... and a lot of other actors. This movie was created by David Benioff and I believe that story was inspired by a book of Georges R.R. Martin.

      Obviously, media has changed in forty eight years. When I was growing up, there was only one tv network in black and white. Today, there are hundreds of networks through cable in high definition or even in 3D. There are more and more e-media and less and less newspapers and magazines.But it's not because people want to read news on tablets, it's because traditionnal newspapers are very expensive to produce. And what about the informations broadcast ? Are there more accurate, more interesting than before ? I don't think so. What is called information today is often rumors or poor ideas. I'm still very attached to paper and to real books. E-medias are cold and make me often angry because you have to click to go to another page or to delete ads...On the other hand, paper is &quot;warm&quot; : it's relaxing, it's as if I had a direct link with the author, with his mind without the barrier of the screen.

      I'm totally agree with the law in Australia regarding the use of cellphone while driving. This law permit to have less accident on the road. Contrary, in France the law permit the use of cellphone while driving only if the conductor use a hands-free kit. I think it's not a good idea because even a person use a hands-free kit, this person isn't totaly concentrate on the road and so, there is a bigger risk of accident. Finally, I think that in France, the law should be as strict as the law in Australia.

      Physiological needs such as food, clothes, warmth,... can be easily satisfied when one have much money. I have all these things. Safety doesn't mean that you stay at home and feel safe. Safety means that you can control your life, and know how to protect yourself from any danger. I can do this. Love and affection: I've got a warm family and good friends. My husband loves me and cares for me. I am really happy. Self-esteem and self-confidence: I took a good formation and became a good dentist. I can earn money and help people around me. It makes me understand my values and have confidence in myself. Self-actualization: When I feel really happy and satisfied with my life, I want to give a hand to others to help their life more comfortable. I give free dental treatments for poor patients, and put beside a little amount of money every month to establish my own orphanage at later time. This will help to reinforce the major part of homeless children to have more chance in the pathway of finding success and happiness.

      Dear Mister Robert Righter, I want to study online for two principals reasons. Indeed, I haven't enough time to take some courses at the university because I have a job whitch takes me a lot of place in my life. Therefore, it's easier for me to go back at my home and put myself on my computer to study. The second reason is that I would like to have an advantage in my current job. It is necesarry to speak fluenty english to get that advantage. Subjects I would like to study are very large. Indeed, I think largest are the topics learned, more learning is efficient. Nevertheless, I would prefer to learn the language with culturals topics. To finish, my principal goal to learn online is first of all take pleasure and in the same time to succeed in speaking fluently the language. I hope to have answered to yours interrogations and hope to learn online with your help. Sincerely. Yohann DELABRE

      In France, the education is obligatory from six years old up to sixteen years old. But the school at home is staying legal. Unfortunately, there are many pupils and students in difficulty. Education system becomes unequal , the quality is damaged itself gradually . In french school, language teaching is very inefficient. Education system must become more reliable for all children. We must revalue teaching profession morally, materially and socially. In France, there is always a competition between public and private. Private school are too expensive , and public school are free . But for example ,the public university where engineers has been trained are certainly better considered than private school.

      Corporate social responsability is one of the main issue related to company's governance in the XXI century. Nowadays people start to be aware of the environmental and social impact companies' actions have on the local community. In this context, CSR became a top priority for firms that wanted or had to improve their image. Beyond the branding issue, the very meaning of CSR is not just about bordering your impact on the society or improving work conditions but being truly concerned with the environment within the one your company is developping. Therefore, according to CSR definition, company's responsability goes far beyond its shareholders. Looking at the exemple of Veolia, one of the biggest worlwide water reclycling company, one could argue that CSR deals with the overall production channel, thus tacking into account not only your own impact on society but as well your suppliers' impacts. Indeed Veolia has invested in improoving working conditions of its suppliers and has also supporting water reclycing systeme in restricted aera. Beyond the positive impact of clean water free acces from a social and environmental point of view, the idea was to develop local economy using local workforce and local suppliers.

      In French universities, students have few hours per week studying with teachers. The rest of time is uses to work at home for document retrievials &amp; dissertations. I support this kind of schedule which gives freetime but you have to be very organized and autonomous if you want to succeed. Two time by year there are big tests. If you fail one, you can save the rate another time. It's not uncommon to see students failed the grade because they neglect classes and also their homeworks.

Monkeys are more intelligent and more interesting than giraffes, but giraffes are taller. I think they are friendly. They like bananas, climbing trees. Many are arboreal, although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Unlike apes, monkeys usually have tails.

      I definitly prefer to buy green product over brand which dosen't care of th environement.  But if you really want to choice the right product, with a minimum of information on the energy used, the packaging biodegradable or ,ot and so on you will discover that it's not evident to choose the right one. Sometimes the package is green and the product looks like it is environment frendly or bio but finally you cannot find any relevant information on the way it has been elaborated. So i think that if you are very motivated to use only real green products you have to go out of your way to find the right product.so if you do not have the time and the money to do this, which is my case you could start by changing your day to day behavior by for example using cermique cup instead of plastic glass, cooking yourself instead of buying prepared meals.

      I am pessimistic about the future because first of all we have to think about the environment and the human's needs, but the big companies who lead the world, because it is the reality a few companies lead the world, don't do this. They only think about profit, and they brainstorm in the short term, doesn't matter what will happen in a few years, the main thing is : profit, benefit : What will happen in the future? This will be the next generation's problem, not theirs... Our generation have to become really aware of these problems in order to resolve them.

      I think, French TV is like other occidental TV... There are more and more programs for couch potato, which require no reflection. Don't be pessimistic, few channels continue to be educative and interesting and now with the &quot;replay&quot; we can choose what we want watch. Everybody can choose to watch silly or interesting programs... The question isn't &quot;what's on TV&quot; but &quot;How people will choose their programs?&quot; So, I think TV is just the reflection of the society.

      In France, five or six years ago there was a law to forbid people from smoking in a restaurant or a bar and also in public venues. First in my opinion, it was unnecessary and besides it was an infringement for people's freedom. Then, with time, I can see that this law was a good thing. Nowadays people are happy to be able to eat or to have a drink in a clean space. Today our government has decided to rise up the price of cigarettes. They argue that this measure will, in one hand prevent people from smoking and on the other hand to fight against lung cancer. It's a good thing to try to save lifes. But finally, to my mind this decision is not a really good. First there's a lot of tax on cigarettes. With that money I'm convinced that we can find some ways to fight against lung cancer. Secondly, it seems to be a good thing to try to improve the people's way of life. But what about redundancies. I think that to become jobless it's also very bad for the health. It's just my point of view, maybe I'm wrong.%%

      In Colombia, where I was born, there are too many strict laws but I'm fed up with those because no body follows it. Normally you can't drive while talking by phone or even worse if you are drunk. Another thing I find wrong is that the fine to pay depends on who is the violator, for example, if is the president who is making the infraction, he won't pay anything or he will get a discount, by the other side, if is somebody like me, I'm going to prison and I have to pay a several fine. I think the results are the same even if I or the president are the law's violator. People are afraid because the laws are not equalities on each side.

      Instructions for Frisbee Bowling Make an area about 8 meters by 3 meters. Use ten plastic bottles with a little water to make the &quot;bowling pins&quot;. Line up the bottles like ten-pin bowling. Give a frisbee to each player. On each turn, shot twice. Each pin that is knocked down, scores one point. If you make a strike, you have two more shots and all the points are added together. To win, you must have the most of points. If it's windy day, it could be difficult to play.

      Success is often associated with financial and social success. The image that comes to my mind when I think of success is a hard-working and busy businessman, who is very rich and respected by people. I imagine a man who runs behind schedule but who has the time to show his wonderful and elegant woman during fashionable evenings. Businessmen are respected because they embody the power. On the contrary, a spiritual person like Soeur Emmanuelle, who owned nothing, was admirable because she was herself and made us aware of the essential things. I consider that Soeur Emmanuelle succeeded her personal life because she remained faithful to herself and to her deepest aspirations. She found the meaning of her life by believing in God and by helping the most needy. However, you can find some similarities between these two examples. The businessman and the spiritual person both have a goal and do their best to reach it. They both have qualities and skills that lead them to success like intelligence, a great involvement in what they do, an extraordinary strength of character and perseverance. Despite these similarities, I cant help thinking that the businessman is just gifted like thousands of businessmen whereas Soeur Emmanuelle is an exceptional human being.%%

      I just heard a song by Josh Woodward called 'Walking Home Improvement.' What a classical folk pop song! We had the impression to have already listen this song. You want to dance when you heard this song because of the beat of this song. I like the instrumental guitar at the middle of the song. The mood of this song is happy but the description of the man life is the opposite. The singer prefer is old life, it's a little bit sentimental and sad storie. But if you like pop song, you' ll really appreciate this new song of Josh Woodward.

      Sometimes we have to work 9 hours a day, sometimes we do not have work but generally when we have one, either you should work more and more, either they take 2 or 3 people instead of your place. They never give you the right number of hours to do. You have to treat 300 mails per a day, so, it's impossible to go home before because the next day your mailbox should be busy so that you can loose important emails. That's life in airbus, either you have lot of work, and when it is simplified, they put another people on it. I happy now not to work I have no stress for holidays and enought time to forget job.

      In France, manners and etiquette is fairly important. It's not only a matter of respect but a way of living as well. Recently, UNESCO has decided to include the french way of organizing a dinner or lunch as a part of the world heritage. That shows how much it's important for french to behave correctly when being invited but also to behave properly when inviting guests. When being invited, it's important to arrive on time or 10 minutes in late but never before. A host should never come without a small gift. Flowers or wine are always appreciated. From the host side, it's important to decorate the table and to invite the hosts to take place a woman near to a man and never two persons of the same gender nearby. The lunch or dinner should start with appetizer, then fish, meat, cheese, salad, dessert and coffee. Even if the lunch takes hours, it's really impolite to leave to go to smoke a cigarette for instance, or to call someone.

      In France, the trend is to go at Univertsity,or to go in a college. However, there are several differences between both. For example, University is public whereas the most of colleges are private schools. Because of their cost, these colleges are not accessible for everybody, even if college courses and teachers in these colleges are very good. Besides, it's not uncommun for students to take a credit in order to pay their studies in those schools. To conclude, it's important to notice that those schools often have good networks for their students, in order to apply for job after their studies.

      The Hang Seng index is a bullish market. Except a fall this month, the trend is extremely positive and our magazine advices you to buy long positions. This stock market has an enormous potential. First, it benefits from an amazing geographic zone. For example, growth rate is about 8% per year. It creates more opportunities than in old developping countries. Then, all the companies of the index are not recommended. You have to examine the sectors of activities before investing. We are up energy, health, and telecoms, to catch high dividends this year. To finish, do not forget your stocks investments have risks. Be sure you are conscious of the encoured risk and that you are understanding the investment. In addition to the stock risk, you have a change risk. The funds are in us dollar, and the stock are in yen. So the stocks are converted in dollars. Don't forget that point. And if you invest a high sum, you can have change protection. For this special point, please contact your banker.  Notes for my teacher : &quot;I can t see the graph and the notes, this story is invented. Sorry&quot;.

      Hi Gerald, I am writing to let you know that I have some good news to share with you. As you certainly know, recently we got some trouble with our old client Roland. Indeed this latter asked us to reduce the minimum number of delivered items required and at the very beginning of our conversation he was really annoyed but I carefully explained to him our company's policy. Then, I described accurately the expensive costs we had to face to ensure a high-quality delivery's service namely since we always comply with due dates, our company want to provide the best transportation possible.%% Furthermore, the past few months we faced tax increases and the raise of the gas prices. After these explanations he changed his minds and he confirmed that he always was satisfied with our services. So everything goes well now. Feel free to give me a call if you want further details.

The pins are lined up in rows of 4, then 3, 2 and finally 1. Each player has a frisbee and can shot it twice. When you knock down all the pins at the same time, you make a &quot;strike&quot; and win two more shots. The winner is the one with the most points. Don't play this game when it is windy!!!

      Before NLP: She worked from home and her daughter was also staying at home . She constantly interrupted her so she felt very frustrated at her. She was lacking sleep and so she was acting negatively with her daughter. Techniques applied: First she tries to have a positive attitude. Then she analyses the situation with multiple perceptual positions. She imagine how her daughter was feeling. Then she identifies the negative behaviours. In this case, there was two negative behaviours: one from her and one from her daughter. She searches the positive aspects behind this negative behaviours. She finds out that her daughter wanted more attention. Then she seeks for alternative ways to fulfill the positive intentions behind the negative behaviour.

If you have an infection, take garlic and Echinacea tea ; it will avoid you to go to the doctor and take any antibiotics.

      In all Europe, improvements have been made in the subject of gender equally for 50 years. After the voting right, the abortion right was obtained in 1980. That was an important social advance as the victory was won side by side with men and not against them.  However, we have to continue to seek the total equality for example about wages.  By the time,  the gender concerns are very important within specific politic regims which try to lower the women rights level. In those countries women can't have education or health care as effective as men are used to enjoying. We must endorse them.

      what about the future? A lot of people are worried about it. And they feel ever bad when we talk about technology  in the future. It looks like scary for a big part. Why ? It seems difficult to figure out what kind of life every one could leads with its own robots. scientists are very optimistic because they already explain that they know what to do with. But for common people, cleaning house or taking care of elderly is not so natural that it seems. For instance, does robots will take care of elderly as they'll do for pets? They don't have heart! the human body is made of cells but also of one heart which has to be considered!

      Regarding social and professional life, etiquette is still really important in France. Everybody is supposed to know some common rules as not putting elbows on the table while having lunch. But some rules are more subtle. They are a marker of social status. Many people don't realize how essential they are, or don't want to. But breaking them, can be harmful. For example, when a member of lower classes greet someone, he says 'Bonjour Monsieur Dupont&quot; whereas one of upper classes would say Bonjour Monsieur&quot; without the name. When you get into a drawing room, you have to kiss on the hand of the hostess, but not the hand of the other women who are guests. It would be very impolite. All of that could seem frivolous. It could be said: It doesn't matter. But in fact, that's not the case. It's necessary to sustain career and upward social mobility. For instance, as a partner of a law firm, I always pay attention to good manners of a candidate before hiring him, because some of our clients are extremely demanding on proper etiquette. It's a corporate identity's issue. So if I can give advice.%% You're expected to respect the customs, even if they can look like old fashioned. That the best method to work your way up the ranks.

      It is difficult to write something about office politics because there is no hierarchy in our office. We are six doctors and there isn't any chief. Nevertheless, I must admit that they acknowledge me as a leader. To lead them, I have to be very careful with any of them. I must develop some strategies we could call &quot;office politics&quot;. I often seek for advices to my colleagues. I listen to them each time we have to put a decision. After every meeting, I ask my best friend and colleague what could be improved in the way I manage this metting. When some decisions are difficult to adopt, I can explain it, seeking an advocate in the team. Finally, writing these lines convince me that office politics are not a concern only when there is a hierachy in the team... I use office politics every day in our medical center.

      Hey everybody, I have listened this song &quot;Home Improvement&quot; from Josh Woodward. It's a country music. I'm not a specialist of country music but this singer has kind of a sentimental melody. The text of this song is interesting, it's about the story of his life. This is about a farmer who sold his home to start a new job into Hardware store, to improve his life. He lost his new job and have a lot of regrets. It's pretty catchy. I have always this mood in my head. There is much of the beat with a nice song of guitar and drums. Best regards

We mainly talked about the brand new legislation concerning the thermal regulation of private and collective buildings. We shared the same opinion, that is to say it will be difficult to apply it by January. I submitted the idea to create a national database with all insulation products and their technical specifications, in order to facilitate the access to the data and their quality. They seemed to be very interested ! Some of them took my card and I think they'll call me soon.

      My all-time favorite movie is &quot;Le fabuleux destin d'Amlie Poulain&quot;. This movie can be considered like a romance, whereas the love story doesn't take all the place in the movie. This movie was directed by J-P Jeunet, who makes really specials movies with an original atmosphere. It made me discover Audrey Tautou who played the first role. The plot happens in Paris in the years 1980's. The soundtrack is one of the most famous in France, composed by Yann Tiersen. I've already showed this movie to my children and my daughter loves it too.

      Dear Robert Righter ,To reply to your email , please find here after the answers to the questions that you asked to me.I want to study online because I guess it's the more convivial manner to learn a new language.You can learn when you want ,on midday , after your work , or during the weekend for example , you can organize your day as you decide.Online you can improve your english by reading exercices or grammar drills but also by seeing movies , by talking with other people in the friends community and obviously in conversation classrooms and that is very interesting. Subject I'd like to study would be for example &quot;all that you need to know when you travel abroad&quot; ( sentences you have to use at the airport, in the hotel, in the restaurant , when you have to ask for your way.....) The aim that I hope to achieve is to be more confident with english language ,at work because I have customers in many parts of the world but also during vacations because I travel all over Europe .Understand and be understood by other people would be great. Best regards

      France is a beautiful country, visited by millions of people each year.  If you are invited to a French person's home, Here are some tips for you to be polite with your host: Do Bring a small gift, to say thank you. A bottle of wine because the French people adore wine especially if it is red wine, a bunch of flowers, or a box of chocolates is enough. Compliment your host on the cooking, because over the last five years, the French people made a real improvement on cooking because of the attraction of the cooking TV shows. Don't Talk about money, religion or politics. Speak louder than your host, it's rude to do that. Arrive early because your host may not have the time to prepared himself. Get drunk when you arrive to your host home

      Naturals remediesThe best naturals for pains is to made a tea with willow bark and cayenne pepper. Be careful, drink it warm, and try to drink that twice a day. With that, your pain disappears quickly and you will be better. You'll be in shape. It's a amazing remedy.If you have an infection, don't take antibiotics, prefer Garlic and Echinacea tea. The taste is not very good, but it's better for your body than antibiotic and it's a natural remedy.Do you have fever ? It's incredible, but wear socks soaked in vinegar an thyme. Disgusting but very efficiently.

      Two days ago I participated to one of the worst presentations I've ever seen. One of my colleagues gave us a presentation about one of the strategic projects for next year. First of all he didn't made any introduction and he didn't had a map of his presentation. This is why all the audience didn't understand at the beginning what he was talking about. When he started to detail the gains and the market share he did had some very compelling pie charts and I liked this because for me was very clear how we should approach this project. He also summarized the key points but his finish was very bad structured. He forgot to save some time for the questions and no spectacular information were shared. However, I think that we all understood that we where there to share a very important project for our business continuity.

The lyric are not so happy, it's not a sentimental song but it does'nt make happy. This song can be interresting for people who likes this kind of music.

The stress can cause problems in their life. Their work-life balance is not well. They must  be competitive to keep their jobs. The second group, the state employees have less stress. They are not afraid of losing their jobs . They work only 35 hours a week while in the private companies the people must work about 50 hours a week. In France , we have too many state employees.This administration is magic, it arrives has to complicate things which should be simple. I know what I say,I am a state employee.

      They're are about 3 years ago, I worked for a hairdressing salon. I starded to work there when I was 16 years old and in this time I was young and moyey did't interest me because I just wanted to learn the job,she didn't paid me . But after a few years, my boss started to meet some probleme because she didn't had  a diploma to exercise her profession, and the hairdresse's met some probleme as the lack of loyal customers and also between us, it wasn't more as before, cause I wanted to be payed more. To resolve the solution, she hired a new employee with a diploma in her hand. And 2 years after that, I left the hairdressing salon to complete my studies .

      Do still exist gender differences in Gabon? The answer could be yes. Over the years, roles haven't really changed. Men always see women such as the person which caters to the needs of the family. The latters are supposed to take care of children, to clean the house and to cook. Men prefer to keep their wifes at home. Women have tried to change this view. Most of them work today and foster equal rights. In fourty years time, a lot of women had gained access to important positions especially in politics. Unfortunetaly, the men outlook didn't change at all. The main problem is the contradiction between Gabonese traditions and modernity. In fact, women want to live freely or to keep the control of their life but the burden of the society and the traditions stop their actions. May be, in few years, we will have founded the perfect balance between men and women roles.

      The company is called The Earth. The main problem is that more is used than what can be produced. So this company goes poorer and poorer and the employees ( who are also the customers) don't understand that they shoot themselves a bullet in their feet. The solution is not easy to do. It is mindfullness for everybody and to take care of us and others in a manner that poverty could desappear and joy would grow up in the population. I dream that this will be learned at school. To this solution we don't need meeting nor brainstroming. Just to use the quantity that the Earth can produce. Yes a dream. We are the boss and the employees so go on. Save The Earth.

      I'm amazed at how violent TV is in thFrance. Some detective programs show all the details of people getting shot. You see fighting on the news every day. Some cable channels even show real people getting murdered. I feel strongly that the rating system doesn't always help, because children are sometimes home by themselves and can watch what they want. Basically , TV is violent, but I think we can make it better. We need to stop watching these violent programs and demand more educational ones.

      In France, we appreciate polite behavior. You expected to say &quot; bonjour&quot; &quot;merci&quot; and &quot; s'il vous plat&quot; when it's necessary. It's usual when you are invited for a dinner, to give some flowers or a bottle of wine to the host, even for casual party. Don't forget to say &quot;excusez-moi&quot; when you bump someone. On the other hand we are not chocked when people kiss in the street. But I know that French people have bad reputation in the world, they are often offensive and rude, especially in Paris. It's not true for everyone and I know that the most of us are very polite.

      I attended your presentation this morning and I have to tell you that I have been really impressed by your speaking skills. The audience couldn't help listening to you, your voice was clear, your words wisely chosen, and you found the right moments to crack a joke, getting the ambient mood more relax. Best of all, you'd had the good idea to propose a few visuals in order to make your audience more comfortable with the topic, helping them to understand the key points. However, If I had to point out a weakness it would probably be the few time you left to your audience between the different parts of your presentation. As a matter of fact, they didn't have time enough to ask you any questions. Everytime one of them was about to hold his hand in order to draw your attention, you went on and began the next point. But don't worry, you were fantastic !

      I live in France but my girlfiend is Portuguese. The pointers about the politeness depend of the country you live. For us, the most important is to say &quot;Good afternoon&quot; and &quot;Thanks&quot;. In Paris, the behaviour of the people is less polite because of the stress. We are hurry to come back home by train. I think that French people are less pilote that the strangers imagine. Being polite must be taking care of the others but too much people are selfish and certainly tired. People who live in the South of the country are more relax, more polite. However, the politeness depend of the education. If you are invited, bring flowers or a bottle of wine but avoid to speak politics, money or religion. It's quite different in UK.

      Sara is a brilliant manager. When she arrived in the company, there was a negative and quite competitive atmosphere. She knew how to modify the organization and our way of working to engage a more cooperative way and to develop self-confidence for each other by always using a positive way to express her view. We are not anxious to bring something up when we have a meeting ! What a pleasure!  Nevertheless, she is sometimes too friendly and some of my coworkers are more passive than before because they aren't afraid of her. I don't say a manager has to be pushy, but, on my opinion, it is important to show a bit of authority.

      My vocabulary strategies : When I was a student I used to learn long lists of unknown words. It was helpful to pass the exam but now I realize that I don't remember anything. Such a waste of time! Now, to help me with vocabulary, I read a lot of books, especially detective novels. When I meet a new word I try guessing the meaning with the other words of the sentence.  Furthermore, when I attend a lesson, I try to write down all the new words I hear in order to practise saying them and perhaps remembering some of them.

      Despite the choice of channels, the diversity and quality of programs are disappointing, there are too many reruns. I fell strongly that there are not enough fims or cultural programs.

      English became an important language in my life. When I was young, I didn't see how it could be and how it will be important for me. English was just a lecture like another. It was boring for me to learn irregulary verbs, and doing grammar. I had preferred studying sciences, thinking it was more useful. But when I grew up, I realised that I was missing something and I was needing english. First, I became passionate by travels. Communicate with people or others travellers is useful when you travel but also very mind-expanding. Subsequently, I started my master's degree in trade and marketing with a mandatory speciality: international. Within business and economy area, english is playing a major role, so, if I wanted to continue my career in this way, I had to learn and improve this language. Learning english is not easy, quick and efficient by following lectures in France...So, I decided to pack and flight to USA for few months, to work and lean directly within an english country. Then, I have down my studies in Ireland. Gradually, I became better. English needs to be practice everyday. I cannot do it at work, so, I travel when I can, I watch my movies or series in original version, and I improve it on englishtown.%%fr! ;)

      It's easy for the media to tell whatever they want, only because they have seen someone doing something or meeting someone. If the celebrity sues the media for gossip, they have enough money to be defended and would have earned so much money by selling magazines than they aren't afraid about that. I don't mind what happens in the celebrity's life. In my opinion, life is private. However they are well known, and unfortunately for them, must accept than everybody wants to know about they private life and talk about that as we are doing.

You must take your passport. You give them to the check -in and you will have your boarding pass. Ask for a window seat: it's better for you because it's your first fly!%% Don't hesitate to ask for help. People are very nice in the airport! Have a good trip! Brigitte

      Dear Sir, Thanks for your answer, I'm very happy that you are interesting by my application. Why I want to study online, there are many reasons. First, It's better for me to study on line because I'm working and I haven't more time to learn. Like this, I can working when I'm free. Second, I haven't a good memory of school because it was difficult for me to speak ahead other students. I would like to study to perform my qualification and to be easier in english. I know that I make a lot of grammar mistakes. That's why I want to study on line. I hope also to achieve with the online study program because when I'm starting something, I think that I'm engaged and I must finish what I have begun. I think I am very tenacious. I want a diploma to certify that I have followed the online study program. It's just for me, to prove me that I can do what I want. Thanks for you attention and best regards. Mrs Jones

      Let me tell us about the new self-helped book &quot; How to Make a Career out of Courage &quot; by Judith's Wight's. The strength of this book is that it helps workers to consider what interest they find in their profession or could find in another one. The weakness of this book is that it's not very realistic in the context of crisis and difficulties to get a work. But finally, it will help some people to change a difficult work which is boring with another which will be more exciting ! It claims that the search for the perfect career is a lot easier that it seems !

      Report: Concerning the Sales Figures of the 'Manbag' in Asia and South America Introduction:  This report was requested by Bill Samson, CEO of New Line Clothing &amp; Accessories, to understand why sales of 'manbags' are so bad in South America compared to Asia.  Methodology :  Samples of 1000 people covering all the demographics, one in Rio de Janeiro and another one in Shangha,  were questioned as to their responses to the 'manbag'.  Findings:  - The product is not approved by 65% in Rio (vs only 20 in Shangha) - Only 20% would buy in Rio (vs 40% in Shangha) - The main reasons for disapproval are : Design, Size, Color, Material.  Conclusions:  - tastes are different among regions over the world - not enough market research was carried out before launching Recommendations: - do more research about what men want and need in an accessory - Main things to change for Manbag in South America are :  - a more sporty design,  - a slighty bigger size - strong primary colors and B&amp;W - leather as best material

      I think that we have, on one hand, some reasons to be optimistic about the future and, on the other hand, some others to be pessimistic.  We master now wonderful technologies that change life for the best in so various fields from healthcare, communication, transportation to household chores. But, in the same time, human greed and egoism have not evolved much since the Old Stone Age and perhaps increased. For that reason, we can fear terrible wars for the natural resources needed by these same technologies. However, communication means like internet and teleconference, cheaper than actual travels, allow people to feel closer around the world. And, because I believe that good persons are all the same all over our little planet, I hope they will be able to organize themselves to prevent another World War.

      This self-help book is very motivating, but is that really possible to change your current job, even though you couldn't wish for anything better in your life.I think it was not so easy, otherwise everyone would be happy in their career, and nobody will be suffering from anxiety or will be under stress at work.Unfortunately these fellings occur more and more nowadays.But, how to tackle the search for a more gratifying career when it's the economic crisis all over the world?To my dismay, I saw my own son who has had a successful school career to be resigned to immigrate to another country because he didn't have the opportunity to find an appropriate job here.Obviously, you can always learn about your personnality,  your centre of interest, but what could it change?In my opinion, this excerpt is unrealistic, we don't live in a fairy tale!

We hidden in staircase, inventing stories about a great priestess of llamas and a count of a place I don't remember, lord of the Maltese dogs (in french they are named bichon!). I think that was my best years, we were crazy, in harmony. Actually I can't see my friends as often as I wish, most of them work, some in another country. And worse of all we are now serious.

      I would like to express the difference between private school and public one. The main difference is independently the price of teaching, as well the way of the teaching. In public school, the schooling is free comparing private one.  Both have the choice of choosing the books they want for education. Parents think that in private school, children are more monitored and the quality of teaching is better Not only because, you pay for it but some unfortunate people can't afford it. .I disagree with that idea. For me, I think all of us have the right to be educated without thinking about the price it might be! I can understand that in some colleges the quality of students is really dreadful! Some of them are here just because it is mandatory. Compare private of public school and decide which one is better than the other one, it is a really tricky question. I haven't seen the result of the good choice in the reality. I think that in the public school, student have to work strongly enough more for themselves because if they don't to it they will flunk out their schooling. I think it is better that all student overcome their success by themselves better than to be monitored.%%

      Dear friend, Before you come in my country, I will give you some tips to make your stay goes well. You shouldn't yell down the street. You mustn't smoke in any public bullding. You must greet people with a shaking hand. You should control your children in public places, it's considered impolite to allow them to run everywhere. See you.

It was inappropriate to ask you so much questions about your money, she really overstepped the mark. Although I'm not looking to give excuses, I did want to explain I had not preview her behavior. She is my new roomate and she just comes from India, so she doesn't know what is polite to talk about and I have not asked her if she knew the american's taboo topics. I promise that it will never happen again. Once again, please do accept my sincere apologies. Best wishes, XX

      Down by the river It was Inspector Mike Clint's day off and as usual, early in the morning, when the city was still quiet, he enjoyed going down for a walk to buy cigarettes or the newspaper. Even tough the sun had just risen, he could easily tell it would be another scorching day in Jackson, Mississippi. Clint was strolling down Main Street when his attention was drawn to the newspapers. They all read the same headline : &quot;Oil tycoon James Tyler found dead&quot;. The article mentioned the 90-year-old-magnat had been found bleeding to death in the lobby of his luxurious mansion in Jackson by his gardener, Joseph Conty, who had been working there for 40 years. Clint jumped into his old chevrolet and hurried to his office. Joseph was being interrogated by his colleagues. The old man had been killed with a sharp object such as a knife or a huge scissor, both of which could be found in the Black employee's toolbox. Clint knew Joseph, a kind, honest, trustworthy man...but he also knew how White justice worked in the Deep South. Racial tensions were like embers on a fire, ready to spark off with the slightest breeze. Especially since the murder of MLK a few months earlier. His colleagues were talking Joseph into confessing his crime, that he had killed Tyler to steal him 500 dollars before calling 911. Clint took over and quickly pointed out some inconsistencies in his colleagues' report. Why did County receive a phone call on that very night, urging him to go into Tyler's mansion? Who called him ? Someone surely needed him to be there. One of his scissors had been missing for a few days. Who took the possible murder weapon? How come County found 500 dollars in his toolbox? The employee was devastated by his boss' death. Clint investigated the magnificent two-story-house, with an impressive entrance staircase and noticed a few missing objects on the wall of the luxuriously decorated interior. He went on to question Tyler's close employees. John Reif, Tyler's so-called right hand man, watched Clint stepping out of his car, took an emeraud incrusted dagger out of his bag, looked at the blade stained with blood,an evil smile on his face and put it carefully in a locked drawer... There was a knock at the door. -&quot;Come in, Inspector&quot; NB : I'm sorry, I know I didn't respect the number of words but I don't understand how it's possible to write a murder essay with 150 words... Maybe I didn't quite understand what was meant by the term &quot;entry&quot;. I look forward to reading to your answer. Will I be able to start again ? Thanks for your help.

      I heard that you wanted to continue education in France. That sounds like a great idea. One good thing is that you will take only two tests a year. You will also able to get a job to pay for the university. But, don't forget to learn regularly if you want to pass the tests. Now, the trend is to give presentations during classes. I am in favor of it because students learn further when they take part in debates. It is not unusual to complete the education by an internship. So, you should apply for ads before even starting your classes.

      I first met my ex girlfriend on a social network. She lived in paris and me in the countryside. She was pretty nice and I love her figure. She was very attractive. She comes from south africa and I loved his accent. But after 6 months , It's was the same. She couldn't be the one for me , I couldn't get around it. I'm normally a kind of person who love to speak with each other but she was so jealous about it. She didn't stand the way I spoke with people.

      When IXW wanted to upgrate their computers (fifty pieces), they chose two models after several negotiations (because of the total price, which the company couldn't afford). After a discussion with the computers vendor, because the price of one model was more expensive than that Todd believed, they changed a model which was cheaper). They tried to decrease the price with a bulk price but the vendor said she couldn't do it with only fifty pieces. They finally found an agreement (the vendor let us the second model for a lower price), IXW bought the computers. Furthermore, the vendor finished the negociation by saying them that the price included a two-year guarrantee.

      I recently saw your advertisement on the Net proposing management training packages. I'm in charge of professional development in my company and I'm looking for a customized course for one of our manager. I notice that it's possible to choose the form of a week-end work-shop which is very interesting for us. The module could include issues related to communication and management skills : learn how to be assertive, to facilitate team meetings, to diffuse tension and listen empathetically. But I attach great value to intercultural communication given the international calling of my company. It seems therefore very important to me to add in this course some items concerning body langage and specific issues about different cultures, status and gender.Could you give me some idea of the content and the price for this type of work-shop?I look forward to receiving this information as soon as possible.Julie

      Dear Mr Smith I'am some idea about the content of the cards. Until today, cards were very similar and interested nobody. When we will touch the public we must use more marketing technic. We must focus more attention to the danger of extension of animals. On the card we must be more pedagogic about the cause of the disaster. On the one hand a photo with the animal in that natural habitat and on the other hand a photo with the animal in a destroy habitat. I think about an oil spill. Remember everyone is interested in environment these days. We must choose the good animal. The best is an amazing animal as the dodo. We should make some jokes about this animal. We must show the pleasure that this animals give to the children. We must remember how many animals we have exterminated and the consequences if nothing is done. I have some other idea and we could discuss the next week. Best Regards Bob

No electric light, but there were candles everywhere.  The server was dressed as in middle age. The cutlery was made by wood and pottery. We ordered T-bone steak and it came with a salad and spice sauce. It was very delicious. As soon as we finished the main course, we both ordered the cream brulee. According the restaurant's server, the food was organic. In the end, my friend thanked me for this party.

      Hi Ian, I just heard about your decision to resign from Stoward Bank. Sarah mentioned you are leaving because of a phobia triggered by the relocation. I also suffered from claustrophobia so I can understand what you feel. My symptoms included anxiety, sweating and panic attacks. I used to avoid long train journey and stick close to exit doors at parties. If I spotted that an exit was closed, it would often be enough to trigger an attack. I would recommend you visit your doctor and ask for advice. I would also suggest you practice some relaxation techniques. These can really help in times of panic and anxiety. Good luck! Don't hesitate to call me if you need to talk. See ya, Sophie

      I am a student in marketing. Prior to that I wanted to study finance but I realized that was too difficult for me and that was not something I will enjoy. So this year I am doing a marketing degree and next year I have to do a one year internship. I want to do it in Dublin because I want to improve my english and furthermore, I think that is easier to find a internship in Dublin than in Paris. Indeed, the employment market in France fells, drastically. So I think that is a good experience to work in Dublin, and if it works, perhaps I will work some years there, the time economy turns around enought in France. But at the beginning, I think  I have not choice to be commercial during 2 or 3 years before finding a better job in haedquarters, like product manager. I believe that marketing career is not the best career to find a job easier but with some experience, it is posible.

      English ,my third language,but for now it doesn't play a major role in my life. I hope it will be changed in future.I learned the  English  sporadically between ages of 14 and 23 ,in my school and university in Russia . I wasn't really hardworking and interested in studying English in this period of my life. In the age of 25 I had immigrated in France and I'd married there.I became very proficient in French (my wife is French) when I studied on my graduate degree in the evening class and in my job also. I continue my studies for master's degree and I'm looking for better job. I'm fairly proficient in English,but I still have things to learn.Like for  many people ,English not only leads to better job opportunities but a better life in general.In fact ,I hope that my constant efforts to learn English and my studies help me realize my wish to working internationally.

      I'm really concerned about expanding the market sales into the both demographic groups. As far as possible, we'll have to follow closely the evolution of the purchases in the next six month according to the market share. On the one hand, we will have used more gossip articles about stars in the magazines to increase the interest from the women. On the other hand, we can notice carefully that there are most competitive products on the demographic group 1 than on the demographic group 2. In comparison, the projections are showing that the evolution of the worth from the purchasing power will be more efficient on the demographic group 1 (estimated to 22 billion between 2010 to 2025). In contrast, the demographic group 2 make very much money in the same period compared. However, the worth of the purchase power seems less valued according to the projections (estimated merely to 2 billion between 2010 to 2025). Thus, I consider to my own advice which is it obviously more cunning to concentrate the effort on the demographic group 1.

      For Frisbee Bowling, we need an area of 8 meters by 3 meters. Use ten plastic bottles as the bowling pins. Fill with a little water to make them heavier. Line up the bottles in rows of 4, then 3, then 2, then 1. For the game, we use a frisbee, you take two shots on each turn. Each players are a total of ten turns. You win one point for each bottle knock down. If you do a strike (when all the bottles are knocked down), you take two more shots and add all the points together. The winner is the player with the most points.

      A prior remark : all properties are fulfilling the location requirement : in Ionian and close to the seaside.1) This cottage wouldn't fit the expectations because it doesn't contain enough bedrooms : only one.2) The Hamilton house has 5 bedrooms but needs a complete restoration. It is a big historical abode that offers a beautiful landscape over the bay.3) This building would not be convenient too because the larger apartment includes only 2 bedrooms.4) This villa perhaps could match the Blight family needs in terms of capacity but we should investigate to know the number of bedrooms it can propose. The problem is that it is only available for investment as a holiday rental business.To summarize, i think the best choice for the Blight family would be the option 2 as money is no object and they are opened to do labour for love.

The least popular program for my age group are cartoons, saop operas and game show but for my point of view the talk show is most unpopular.The survey shows that funny movies are really apreciate with no distinction betwen male and female and i am also completly agree with this one especially in this social climate we need fun.

      Have you already heard a song called &quot;home Improvement&quot; by Josh Woodward ? At this moment until tonight, you can downloud it in itunes for free. But I really don't know how to range it, Is it folk ? rock ? The voice of the singer begins grave and it continues more and more loudly. You can hear two instrumental passages with beat and electric guitar. Even children can sing lyrics, there is no offensive words. Be careful, if you hear several times, you could be addict to the melody and it could be very difficult to get it out from your head. Enjoy it.

There is this social problem against no trobot can do something, but there is too the problem of gasoline and renewable energy. If we don't progress in the sustainable developmentand even if the pollution decrease, in theory, in the next years, the future is uncertain.

      Hello Cathy I recommend to you to come in France after you got your B.S. in the United States. The classes of the first years at university are really crowded here.  Because a lot of people give up before B.S., the courses of Master degree have fewer students and teachers are more available. May be, you would be surprised at the importance of lectures, but there are also a lot of hands-on works to practice. Teachers often have both teaching and research positions. Because of that, courses are at the cutting-edge of the discipline taught and really exciting. An additional big advantage is that university fees are very low. By the way, if your dream is to come here, go for it. Im sure you will succeed. Best regards, Franoise.

      Nowadays management and colaboration are a huge part of the work. To work efficently, you company need a elaborate organisation. I will dwell on few ways required to manage a project. First and foremost, a project need an organisation and a leader. The leader will set up all the management. Without a leader, making a decision will need the entire group's acceptation, which will waste lot of time. Then, a teamwork need meeting. These meetings will not only be used to resolving problem but also dividing tasks between the employees. I advise you to schedule the next meeting in the end of each appointement. It set up a deadline. These meeting can also become a brainstorming. It is more efficient to think as a group than just one. Besides people need time to work alone on their tasks. That is why meetings have to be not too often. When people have so much meetings, they pay less attention in that and the meeting becomes inefficient. On the whole, to make a good teamwork, you need just two things. The first is a leader and the second is dividing correctly the time work between meeting and alone-work.

      In my country, each year, the Festival d'Avignon presents between 35 and 40 different shows. It's one of the biggest Performing arts festivals in the world. It was in the &quot;Cour d'honneur&quot; of the Popes' Palace that festival d'Avignon began in 1947, directed by Jean Vilar, a famous engaged artist.This place was the main venue of the festival: an open-air theatre, for an audience of 2000 people, in the provencal night, at the heart of a monument on UNESCO's world heritage list. Since more than 60 years, during 4 weeks, from the morning to the night, the town offers theatre, dance, music,circus, videos of various styles from the most elitist to the most popular of the contemporary scene. At each corner of the old city you have an amazing choice of performances. A kind of fever takes to the streets because Avignon is also recognized for the &quot;Off&quot;. How explain that about 1000 companies presenting works on their own initiatives, in about a hundred different venues. In the street, you can hear, all day long, these recurrent words: &quot;what you saw&quot;? &quot;What you recommend me?&quot; Last summer I liked this atmosphere...I believe it's unique and very interesting even if you aren't a specialist of theatre.

They write about cognitive therapy (this is when the psychologist ask you to do something every day to feel better) and about medical drugs.

      If you're boring to go to the doctor, I've got simple home remedies for some kind of illness. Take notes. In case you have a headeck, make a tea from white willow bark and cayenne pepper. It's not so good but It helps a lot. But maybe it is your throat which is really painful ? You should take a spoonful of honey and ginger. It will soothe your throat. Finally, considering the approach of winter, I have a really funny remedie for fever. Wear you socks soaked in vinegar and thyme. I'm sure you will be ok after that.

      Hi, dear mum,  how are you? my holidays are finished and it's a good thing because we have had a horrible adventure! Nothing really dangerous. I was with Ophelie and Maena for a walk in the forest when I have lost the way. I didn't have my cellphone and the weather has changed, the rain arrived. We was alone and wet. After two hours, I have found the village and we was able to come back at home. I have been crying because I have been strong all the time that we was lost. Now all is ok! See you soon

      I loved this grilled meat, it was perfect, don't change that ! However, you could improve the quality of the other ingredients, overall the vegetables which didn't seem really fresh. You could also make an effort with the wine you propose, it was very bad. But, the main problem in your restaurant is that when I left it, I was still hungry. You really have to increase the quantity of food you put in your meals !

      Dear Ms Hamilton, I looked carefully into the three images and slogans and my final choice is the image picturing two golfers with the slogan: Golf and Century.The perfect team. It was not an easy decision but let's me explain it. Century watches is a luxury brand, and what's better than golf to demonstrate your premium image. Indeed,the fact to be associated to a sport like golf could bring to the company potential customers and raise awareness to the public. Concerning the ad campaign we have foreseen to carry out several tv spot, radio spot and also advertisement in magazines which target customer are men with means over 35 years old. We intent to target all the different ads to your target customer in order to be the most efficient possible. If you have any questions or remarks, feel free to ask. I look forward to hearing from you regarding our decision. Kind regards. Elanzize Abdallah

      I recently moved from up country to a city named Tours, in France. The city has history, every house, building even churches have history. Nowadays, almost every tower or house is located on a classified area. You can't change your windows without informing the city because it must not keep its look. Old, kind of like Asterix's vilage, there's a castle not so far from my home. The Basilic is being renoved, it's as high as any buisness tower in Paris, but it look more charming because every tower, house, even sidewalks, the go together. They fit like human body parts. It good to preserv a city's history, but when it doesn't allow the city to evolv, to develop itself because of certain manners the city tries to keep going with. It takes too much time to have a projet examined, and there's to many borders not to cross. You can't change your window like that, you have to make demands, you can't instal solar panols like that, etc... Too many rules kill the law. Even if the city looks great, what about the people living in it.

      In france, there are striking differences between men and women. On one hand, women became more feminist than before but the society didn't change really. For example, researches said there are more men who become CEo than women. An other example is the law about an equal number of men and women in big companies' boards of director. Moreove, men earned more than women for the same work. This difference can be explained by the position of the woman in the family. In principle, as at the beginner of the 1900s, she has family duties like about the cook, the kids... One of my teacher said me a short story about a man and and a woman who are mrried and did the same job, lawyer. He said that the woman woke up sooner than her husband. She prepared little for kids for school and she went to work. Her husband at the time is at home, is taking his breakfast... All the day is like this. Men is cool, doesn't work so hard and he has a good pay whereas the woman goes fast because she has a lot a things to do (kids, work, kids, cooking...). And I agree with this teacher, badly.%%

The plot is excellent; never you guess the end of the movie when you watched it; this actors are amazing. The lead is played by Jamie Fox,there is Leonardo caprio and samuel Jackson, they are actors very famous. For me the movies is like a cartoon witch lots of colors. The soundtracks is very important and beautifull; the story is about the slaves in America just before the war civil USA. So If you are never see this moie, you have to see it

If someone from a competitor company to learn it, well you are sure which he going to use that for spread some gossips.2- Don't put to the net some pictures from you (especially wearing a bathing-suit). The pictures remain while several years on the internet.3- Don't chat about your boss not anymore because someday somebody say to him.4-Avoid to converse about your last bargain lost, obviously someone else to benefit for himself.5-Don't seek a new company for work by Social Network. Of course someday a colleague will learn it, so he tell to your boss.

But also because she always smiles, she's really a positive person. She's only 25 but she's got many interesting experiences of life to share. She's very humane. Indeed, she likes enormously humans. Although she's got a social job. She's very open-minded (the most of the time lol). We can discuss calmly about all subjects and don't be agree without becoming angry.

There were seven different burgers and nothing else. They comes with french fries or coleslaw, don't ask for anything else. For dessert, you can choose between cheese cake and... cheese cake! As I have written, it's very simple. It's really delicious too. It's made by a chef who cooks in front of you. Even though burgers are not an original French meal, after this so delicious meal I had, I must say that French street food exists yet!

      Hi Ian,I've heard about your wish to resign. Before you leave, please take  attention to a few words I would like to say as your colleague and friend.First, you should consider the human aspect of the job you want to leave. You belong to a friendly team and your departure will destabilize all of us. For many years we are working together, and we would have helped you to face your problem, if you had asked us.Secondly, I think you can't avoid your phobia any longer, because confined spaces are everywhere. You will be confronted with the same problem all your life if you don't try to control you phobia. I can imagine that you are fed up with those unpleasant symptoms: sweating, shaking,  feeling oppressed every morning must be painful. But you should try the cognitive behavioral therapy: a medical professional would explain  you how to breath when you're in  panic. And if this were  not sufficient, some medications can help you.I hope sincerely you will change your mind and stay with us.Best wishes,A.H

      To: The Board of Directors Re: emergency meeting of the board Dears members of the Board, Following my meeting with Jed, I would like to call for an exceptional meeting of the board. The main purpose will be to find some solutions to issues mentioned below: - his team feels understaffed and overworked, because some members were borrowed by other services, - in consequence, they have a lack of resources, - and at least they feel underappreciated. I already propose to offer some incentives, overtime and bonuses at the end of the project. We should hire some more people to extend the team of the services who borrow the members of this team. We will have to find a solution to re-motivate Jed's team I suggest that Jed could be present in order to describe himself the situation. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Bests Regards.

      I don't know if we can be very optimistic about the future. Because of a huge growth of the number of people on each continent, especially in Africa and Asia, we will have to face a major problem for feeding them all. Intensive farming can be a disaster for the environment, as we can see for the equatorial forest partially destroyed in order to replace the current vegetation by corn plantation or something suchlike. I just hope people will realize that if we do not protect our planet, we could expect some critical situations in the future.

      Hi Anna, I've found an absolutely amazing job for you. Have you ever thought about Flossington Zoo zookeeper? If you haven't, I urge you to consider it. Flossington is offering by far the most amazing job. You will prepare food for animals and feed them on a daily basis. The Zoo offers regular trips to Florida to observe wild crocodiles. That's totally exhilarating! I know you're unemployed, and it is offering $50,000 salary with full accident insurance, one month holidays a year and it's an outside job as you search. I want to encourage you to try for this position. I think this job will be very suitable for you. Why dont' you apply for it? I'm sure you'll be successfull. Your friend

      Hi Everybody, First of all, I would like to thank you for coming here and celebrating the union of marriage of this totally wonderful young couple! My name is Franck and I am one of the best friend of the groom. Obviously, you should think I am going to toast Bertrand, and you are completely right! Indeed, we know each other since for such a long time from now on, that I could share many very funny stories about him...But I prefer to keep the strangest secret...After all he does not exactly married yet! However, I sometimes remember the time we spent on the benchs of the High School. Of course, he used to cheat on me during the exams and was probably the first to avoid working his houseworks. But, he knew how to put a very great atmosphere, and used to be the first to suggest a lot of activities such as sport, entertainment or trips! What I can say to the bride, is that she made an absolutely amazing choice, for sure. I am used to being proud of him, he is loyal, dynamic, smart and devoted to the people he likes. To conclude, I wish the best to both of them and I would like people here to raise their glass to the bride and the groom!%%

      &quot;How to use the NLP reframing in the relationship in a family&quot; by Ron Howard For all the people they are the center of the world. That is particular truth with the teenagers. For us all the thing is very important. They are in a period of life or they build their relationships with others. The parents must learn their to take distance. They must think differently. What would you do if you were my place? It's a type of question they must ask themselves. That is with the teenager but the parent must make the same exercise. Why my daughter make this? What will I do if I was at her place? An other approach it's what think a thirty person when he saw a fight between me and my daughter. The important point when you will applied the NLP reframing consist to exchange the different point of views, namely Me, other and a witness.

      France is a country which is really appreciated by tourists. As a matter of fact, Paris is the most visited town in the world. In my opinion, skyscrapers are not making cities more beautiful except if they have something special, something people want to see by their own eyes. The Eiffel tower is one of those buildings you can't find anywhere else and the possibility to get n the top of it make it even more outstanding to visit. It's also hard to believe that this huge piece of steel had been made for an exhibition and was meant to disappear as quickly as it has been built. But it is still there, and it had become the symbol of the capital. More trivially, the Eiffel tower has got loads of antennas on its top, so it is now a central point for communications. More than just a building, the Eiffel tower has been adopted by the city and that's what makes it a great building.

      The most amazing experience I tried two years ago was driving a racecar on a racetrack. I like speed but I had never did it before. first I had a debriefing with the monitor. After we both got in the car . The monitor drived first and explained me how to negociate turns. At the end of this first round he got out and he said it's your turn. My legs were shaking, I sweated profusely. I did my first round very slowly. litle by litle, I drove faster and faster. It became awesome and enjoyable . I gradually felt myself more and more confident. After one hour training, I drove at a breakneck speed until I got out the track but I wasn't scared. I went back on the track and I went on all a halfday.. We could'nt do more for the first time. It was too tiring. I was so glad to have done it.

      Becoming a good manager is developing leadership qualities. Those qualities are empathy, charisma, confidence, moral agility A leader has to trust his colleagues, must show great people skills, create motivation, be rewarding, hard-working Every one has the potential to be leader, but the qualities or abilities for this are not all delivered naturally to the human nature. So, a future manager has to develop them to achieve his goal. Before, he needs to evaluate himself, to know exactly which are their strengths and weaknesses, so that he can maximize the ones and correct the others. This evaluation is not easy to do and sometimes an external vision is welcomed. It could come from a colleague, a form manager  After, it's necessary to develop a plan to achieve the goal. It could take more or less time, depending of the personality. But, whoever you are, you should always continue to try to improve your leadership and specially use your failures to do it.

Internet ,for example ,had revolutionized our style of work .People who works at home are estimated between 15% and 20% of the total of active population and this proportion will increase probably in 20 years . The part of e-commerce is also increasing . This situation will probably have a negative impact on the unemployment .The development of the renewable energies will probably cause a positif impact on our style of life .But,it's not the only consequence because it will also allows us to preserve our energy for the future . It should be noted that significant progress had been realized in this direction . I can tell that these evolutions will probably have a good and bad impact on our life .The real issue will be our capacity to adapt to this future revolution .

      The movie &quot;A monster in the land&quot; by Bob Lawrence Pitch: The story is about a police investigation. We have a murderer and three victims. The injuries are very curious. Perhaps an wild animal but each murder is during the same day every thuesday. A woman with a terrible dog is behind this story. A old story of revenge. Actors: -The detective, a man with strong presence, charismatic, fifty years old. -The murder, a woman with a big authority. -A dog, well dressed with its master. Other: - The location is the countryside. We must have a good director of photography able to capture the light. - A good jimmy jib because some scenes are particulary difficult. -A good choreagrapher for the pursuit scene in the forest. -A good sountracker is necessary to create an atmosphere of terror. The cry of the animals must be very realistic. -For the script, stunt hunter, gaffer, technician I work with my usualy team. Best regards Bob Lawrence, director

      I like my life. Philosophically, I think I am always at the place I must be at a given time : because what I am, what I do is linked directly with my previous thoughts, behaviors, and actions. Of course, like every human being, I often dream about having a better position, a bigger income so I could purchase a bigger house and car. However, in twenty years in the same company, I had five different positions and each one was better than the one before. I don't see why this evolution should be different in the future: I always try to do my best. Nevertheless, I have two challenges: to master my level of stress in keeping a very regular practice of sports and to have a more satisfacting social life, I mean, to bind ou rebind deeper links with my friends and maybe to found a family.

      Me and my mom went to the restaurant recently called &quot;Opera&quot;. It's our favorite restaurant because there we can order oyesters, crab and champagne which make the simple dinner more festive. The restaurant is just behind the opera theatre and usually after an opera presentation, we go there. This restaurant is very well placed in the center of the city and has a art deco decoration with a beautiful ancien bar all made in mirror and statues holding the chandelier in bronze. The service is irreproachable with a lot of tact and welcoming words. The whole athmosphere is quite impressive and cosy. It's always a pleasure to have a dinner there. I have memorable memories that make my heart beating all the time when I talk about.

      Two weeks ago, I ate at a wonderful restaurant on the harbor of &quot;Villefranche sur Mer&quot; on the &quot;C'te d'Azur in the south of the France. It calls &quot;Le Massa&quot; and offers a splendid view of the sea with some yacht and sailboats. When we arrived there, it was 7.30 p.m. and we saw the beautiful sunset.  The meal and the service were both perfect! As far as I am concerned, first, I ordered a smoked salmon. Then, for my main course, I chose the pluma with a gratin dauphinois. It was just delicious! (pluma is a part of blackpig very tasty!). In dessert, I ordered profiteroles and it was again perfect! I really recommend this one!

      Unfortunately, I am absolutely not interested by laws, politics, and so on. As far as I'm not directly concerned by a law or a restriction, I tend to forget it rather quickly and pass to another thing. It may be a lack of seriousness from me, but it's a fact. That said, I recently heard about the promulgation of a law to ban beauty contests for children. It's quite complicated (the story with the Senate and the National Assembly), but if I got the point, it would seem that it's now officially a felony to organise this kind of contest for children. The organisers bay be sentenced to a prison term of two years, and a 30 000 euros fine. If you ask me, I think it's a good idea. Society doesn't need this kind of show. Otherwise, we teach to young girls that their appearance is their best skill, and this is extremely reductive. In case of victory, the winning girl turns into a little princess with a outsized ego. On the other hand, in case of defeat, the losing contestants can have issues with the perception of themself.

Also, we were all agreed that its vital to create more speaking classes. There is one bad news, by the time we were attending to the meeting, the administration made our schedules, so we cant have a word about it. Some teachers will have to work until 22 oclock!  However, the class will start at eight thirty, so no more delay allowed in class! Look forward to seeing you tomorrow at your office!

After the lesson, my teacher said to me &quot;I guessed that you'd be a surgeon&quot;. So, I decided to apply in the Medical University of Marseilles in 1971. In 1978, I succeeded the resident exam and began my surgical training in General Surgery for 5 years. In 1984, I was nominated as Assistant in a Plastic Surgery Department in Marseilles.

      A survey was conducted about peoples attitudes to voices and British English accents. 5000 people in the UK were surveyed. Here are the most important findings. According to the survey, 81% changed their voice depending on who they are talking to. They want to ensure they are understood. 43% would even change their voices if they could. When asked what accent they would like the most, 60% preferred Standard English and 35% Scottish accent. These results can be compared with those to the question about the most disliked English accents. 55% answered the accent from the Midlands area of the UK (in particular Birmingham), while 45% thought about the Liverpool accents even if The Beatles came from this area. Unfortunately, the origins of people surveyed are not revealed. We only learn that most of the persons said they had a moderately strong accent (72% of the sample). But 4% confessed they have a very strong accent opposed to 6% of people who answered that they had no accent.

      The first time I met my best friend was 30 years ago. We both went to a military school when we were 17 years old.I remember this first day when we met. We were in our collective room and he looked very shy. He looked a little sad, probably because he just left his parents. I have to admit I was probably in the same condition like him.  I went to him to launch a discussion. Then we started to talk about our respective lives, families. And after 30 years we are still talking together. He got married. I did too. They have kids. We do too. It's good to consider that after many years we are still friends.

      I think education in my country is going bad to worse. The educational system is so dizorganised and they don't have teachers in public school. They always choose another job because they aren't pay. Private school are good but quiet expensive abd it's common to see a student have bad words with a teacher. You also have a lot of tests, I think they could have less because it's too much and for nothing. Is typical for students to fail because of the minds of teachers.

Aspirin, antibioctics and so on will not be useful anymore.Garlic crushed with lemon and acerola is great for the immune system : it will help you not to be sick.A spoonful of honey and ginger will help you if you've got a sore throat.If you are congested or have got a nasty cough, make a natural poultice with mustard powder mixed with water until it becomes a paste. Then, place it on your chest.You will avoid to go to the doctor if you follow these receipes;Good health!

      I'm optimistic for the future because i think that new technologies are more performant than before. Countries are conscious that they have to make efforts and discuss together so that they will found in common environment policy for less pollution.  Teleconferencing technology is a good way to participate in protecting the environment. people are travelling less for business, we use of less gasoline, the company makes economy.  We should also pay attention to developing countries because it's a huge market for us, so good for doing business.

      Let me explain you  what have I've learnt about beeing a good leader.Firstly, a good leader must be able to deal with difficulties. He has to take control of a situation and be good at problem solving. In addition, he needs to weigh up the pros and cons and ultimately make difficult decisions.Secondly, he has to be clear when it comes to goal setting. He don't lose sight of the big picture and is always  prepared to take calculated risks.A leader needs also a good attitude with his employes. He must have a strong commitment to people and be prepared to go the extra mile for them. A good idea is to set up a democratic system of involving staff in decision-making.The leader has to be consistent in his morals but flexible and open to change where necessary.

      I you choose France to study you'll have to be prepared to go on job training as often as possible. The trend in our country is getting experience working and studying at the same time. As the cost for studies is very important some students start working for 5 years and then they come back to school to improve their knowledge and get a diploma. Whenever they get this certificate, it is not yet a grant to get a job suitable with their studies but it can help.

      Dear Sir,First of all I would like to thanks a lot for your answer. Following your request, please find hereafter the reasons I decided to subscribe  such a learning program:* I want to study online because I think it's the most flexible way to improve my English. Indeed, between my job and my family it's a little bit difficult to regularly follow conventional training in face to face. You can adapt  your learning program with your schedule. * I would like to study the oral comprehension in order to be confortable when I have to discuss with other people. More I want to improve my fluency because I would like to expand my level of responsibility in my company and more especially to manage foreign people. Business management and sales situations are both of my main subjects of work but it could be interessting to have knowledge in different other areas.* I want to reach a high level of autonomy in English and  good competencies in grammar/vocabulary.I remain at your disposal if you need further information about my motivation.Best regardsCM

      In France, it is common to study in an public university to get a bachelor and a master degree. I think, it is a trend to have a master because now, lots of graduated students don't have a job. I think that online degree are interesting because you can study whenever and wherever. But this is not a trend and there are few qualified organisations. I am in favour of studies but students need advices about counselling and profesional orientation.

      I will say something strange : a good leader is first a good follower ! What I mean is that everybody has to learn first. To become a leader one's has to find a good teacher first, a good leader, and to examine what makes him to be a good one. That's the first step ! According to me, nobody really born as a leader. We all born with strengths and weaknesses and we have to manage with that. One important thing, as much important as to find a good teacher, is to be able to see the opportunities. How many politicians, soldiers, managers in the past would have never been famous if they didn't had the good idea at the right time ? But that's not enough to make a good leader. We can recognize a good leader to his will to share a vision and his ability to persuade others. A good leader is someone different who is able to lead others with him, to convince others and to make them work all together so as to realize his own vision.

      When I was young, I used to play video games on a small computer. I didn't do anything else on it because it was not powerful. Now, I'm using my laptop for many things : buying some presents, looking for a job, communicating with friends, reading news, and so all... Of course, I could do the same on my new smartphone, for example, i can read my emails everywhere with the wireless access. But I think that using so much computer and smartphone is a double-edged sword. Sometimes, it's better to communicate with people directly on meetings. I must be honest : I don't like socials networks.  I think it's the bad way of technology. I prefer speaking with people in a coffee or a restaurant, and not on Internet.

      Mark the 'bowling alley', an 8x3 meters area. Fill the 'bowling pins', plastic bottles with water to make them heavier. Line up the bottles in rows of 4, then 3, then 2, then 1 - just like ten-pin bowling.Give each players a frisbee. Shoot twice on each turn and give each player a total of ten turns.Scores as much as pins he knocks down.Get two more shots if you score a 'strike' (you knock down all the bottles). Win if you get the most points.Be careful not to play this game on a very windy day!

      When I was young I loved fashion, and I knew clothes. Shopping was a hobby for me. I followed the season's trends. I expressed myself through clothes. I'm 57 years old now, and I'd rather wear comfortable clothes. I'm not trendy but casual, and for a special occasion more formal. I'm use to look for French brands that use beautiful fabrics, because I prefer naturel fabrics like cotton or wool. I never wear silk because It's too fragile for me. I'd rather wear long, white, cotton sleeve-shirts with warm, long, beige or black, wollen cardigans. I like to wear them with a pairs of jeans and my old brown French lace-up shoes. Like you see, there are very useful and comfortable for somebody living in the country side .

Once they will understand that they have to find another alternative to their present way of life we will face the Golden Age.

      Since the loos of our partner number one for reasons of quality, we need to replace this lost revenue with our other partners. However, we don't know the market well enough for the others partners who are very differents. So, today I can't see as many customers as before. I have to find a lot of new customers. I think that I must to organize myself better and mainly identify the key customers. So, I propose that I stay at the office for 2 month and so I won't see any customers for this time. Consequently, we will have to save money because we no longer have charges displacements. The mains advantages are the savings of money and search key customers in order to increase the sales in the future. However, the disavantages are that the work of research clients is long and tedious, and for many month the sales will be bad, but it''s a blessing in disguise. And for my point of view, we have no choice.

      The whole question of CSR is a difficult one. There are powerful arguments on both sides of the issue. On the other hand, it can be argued that corporations owe nothing to society other than running their businesses, paying taxes and following the laws of the country. The job of taking care of society is for the government. people don't ask politicians to make products, so why should we ask companies to solve society's problems? On the other hand, companies have a big impact on society. If a company's factory pollutes the environment, then it should pay to clean it up. If a company hires workers, it should provide fair pay and benefits. Companies can also help the communities where they operate. After all that community is letting them do business there. It's a two-way street. Personally, i'm in the middle. I think a company has to follow the law and be held responsible if it does something that negatively affects people or a community but I also think you can't force companies to do good. Corporations can be a force for good in the world, but only if they decide that it's in their own best interest.%%

      I like to go to restaurant on the week end with my friends. The Bistro de la tour is my favorite restaurant. Restaurant's specialty is French food. I always choose a french menu. So , the entrees, you'll have a escargot persillage and a salad. They'll offer you one alcool-free cocktail.  You have a steak served with french fries and green beans or fesh salmon with rice and for the main course. And there is a sorbet lemon or a mousse chocolate...for your desserts. The servers are so friendly. The price is reasonable the 15euro menu. On the week end, the restaurant is very busy, you need to make a reservation before at least two days ago.

      I'm proposing a new recruitment software. I know that some people believe that the actual method is the best. But we haven't any , and who search this one.  Another advantage is the easy constitution of a big CV banks.  The principal cons is the excessive cost of this software. We have to discuss about this proposition during a meeting.

      The office culture where I work is mixed, there are parts of my firm which are very formal and the others are more relaxed. My internship takes place in the middle of those two styles. There about 12 people in my office they are Contract Manager, they manage the entire print system for theirs customers. When they have reunion, all the employees have to wear a suit and tie. Due to my grade, I haven't any reunion.  My working hours is about 35 hours while the others work long hours. At the beginning, it's was hard for me to have a healthy work-life balance, I was extremely tired and I was stressed out every day but now I feel much better.

      I have traveled in many countries : USA, canada, greece, mauritius, runion island, norway, laponia in sueden, spitzberg. During my trip I like to hik. In runion Island we crossed the Island with backpack. I was really hard but the montains are fabulous. In the spiztberg we stayed 10 days in the toundra with no accomodation : we slept in a tent, we ate cans, we went to the toilette in the nature ... We made hiking and kayak on the see near the iceberg. It was amazing, especially when we saw a polar bear !!

      Obviously, I can honestly consider that I have a comfortable life and a wonderful family! Although unemployment has dramatically increased in my country, I have got an interesting job and my husband too. We are both active and working as teachers at the same high-school in which the whole atmosphere is very pleasant. We like our job because we like the connection with adolescents. Well, most of the students who are attending the high-school are quiet and well educated so,  teaching them every day provides us a great satisfaction. Moreover, even if we have to be thrifty to manage to pay off the mortgage, we live in a comfortable house with our three children. Compared with the stressful life in Paris, living there,near the Ocean is a real pleasure and we often enjoy walking up by the sea on Sundays. Anyway, everything would be almost perfect without my daughter's serious illness. She is struggling against cancer since two years which have utterly changed our life and our mind. Nowadays, I am used to thinking that life is made of plenty of very strong quality times that we musn't pass it up because it's called:'HAPPINESS' .%%

      In my opinion they are too much reality shows on TV in my country. This reality channel are very silly and absolutely not educational. And we have not rating system for this type of shows. We have even rating system for the more violent movie. So kids can watch on every channels sully reality shows. Ans I feel strongly that this programs make people stupid and not give the good values for the younger . For example we gave so many reality shows to find love. So you are a man or a woman in the show who selects among many contenders with whom she would like to spend her evenning, next day...And in real life it doesn't happen like this ! Kids mustn't to believe that it's the way to take to finf love (for example).

      Dear Janice I am writing to say how terribly sorry I am for Selma's behavior. It was very rude and intrusive of her to talk about money and to ask you how much you earn. She certainly didn't mean to offend you and to be impolite. Although I'm not looking to give her excuses, I did want to explain her reasons for putting her foot in it. It's just that money is not a taboo topic in her country. On the contrary, it's very polite to show your hosts that you noticed how wealthy they were. Selma didn't know that it was very inappropriate. I promise that she will never overstep the mark again. Once again, please do accept my sincere apologies. With best wishes MAP

      My dream is to be a specialist in Japanese translation. In fact, I 've ever gone to Japan because  generally speaking,  I do like Asia and all the culture that emanetes from this civilization. Since childhood, I have always considered that speaking into  a different language than oneself  to get into contact with everybody  was  very interesting and almost magical. It's the reason why I decided to study Japanese at &quot; langues Orientales&quot; in Paris. Although I still have to pass  more and more difficult high- level test, I don' t despair of currently  writing and speaking  Japanese.

      For me the TV in France like to occidental TV. My first thing, I feel strongly that the reality show is stupid and it's not good for teenager becaure they feel it's a real life. For example a lot of teenager indentify themselves about reality show people and they want to make the same stupid things. My second thing, TV need to educate children and not show a lot of violence or commerciales. In my opignion TV can help educate children. For example TV can learn children world history. We need to change the TV programs for that us children are educate.

      Cottage: it has been recently renovated but the roof needs to be changed. Moreover there is only one bedroom. I think it would not be suitable for the Blight family. Hamilton House: it is a historical house located in a picturesque village on the seafront. There are plenty of bedrooms but maybe it's too big for a holiday house... New apartments: ideal for people who want to invest in tourism but maybe not cosy enough. Villa and business: it may be really too big and not personal enough for the Blight family. In conclusion and if I were a house seller, I would propose the Blight family to visit the Hamilton House and the new apartments because the 2 are really different although they both gathered the Blight family's requirements. Then it's up to them to make their choice!

      I never thought the smartphone will affect my life so much. First of all, it's amizing, you don't need to be at the office all the day : people can reach you wherever you are and you can answer or not. You can also listen to music, artists or play list as you want. From several months it's possible to use it as a 3G card wich is very interesting when you travel. I'd been reading newspapers before I bought my smartphone and know I just have to download the information. It's realy powerful, it's impossible to mention all the applications you can use ... a true revolution !

      The Pre Tranquille is a great restaurant in the Vieux Nice. They have many different menus with a large choice of entrees, main courses and desserts. The hot goat's cheese with honey entree is wonderful, and the mussels are excellent. Their diverse risottos are originals: with the seafood or with vegetables for exemple. Finally, they have an authentic dessert, their speciality: the iced Profiteroles, with warm chocolate sauce and cream. They're the best Profiteroles I ever ate! The restaurant has a beautiful little courtyard with some table, very nice and quiet. The servers are pleasant and friendly (pretty unusual in France). The menu prices are reasonable having regard of huge quantities, between 20 and 20. The restaurant is very busy on the summer and the weekends, so make a reservation.

      Hey !  Let me see When I was a child, I lived in an island, La Runion, near Madagascar. All summer over there, there are many cyclones! Im remembering one which was terrible! We hadnt electricity during few days. The wind was so strong and it was raining all days. We were locked in the house and waited the end of the cyclone. Outside, it was flooding. And also, we were so worried because our cat wasnt with us it the house. After the cyclone, my brother looked after our cat and found him in neighbors garage.  See you,

      Hey Dillon, Thank you for the organization of my birthday. So I can surfing too because it's too exciting. But I don't like scuba diving because is not interesting enough, I think it's too boring. I love sailing because it's too relaxing. I don't like playing football or badminton but I like doing yoga and go running. And I can play the piano and the guitar. Thanks for your investment, Celine.

      I first met my friend, Azilis, at the scuba diving at the Sorbonne University. I didn't have many friends there, and she arrived 2 months after me. As usually, we swam and dived in the swimming pool, then we went to a bar, near the swimming pool. We began to talk, and we became friends. She's cute, with her curly hair and her freckles. She's passionate by diving and ocean and marine animals, and she would like travel every time, like me. Now, I have know her for a couple of year, and we spend lot of time together, she's my best friend.

      Hi Tim, I red your e mail with interest and amazement but I have lived a similar story .In New Caledonia we have tropical cyclones and the weather forecast informs the population, we have always foods , water and candles at home. The last cyclone Erika was bizarre. Firstly, he arrived near the island and two hours after he has disappeared. Radars had losted the cyclone in the night but it was around and he arrived with a strong wind and rain. We were afraid in the cyclone's eye and ten minutes after it will begin again with more strengh. Fortunately the speed reduced the split time and nobody has been injury. I am happy you are save See you Yolande

      Hi Anna, I have good news for you and I can promise that this is totally amazing. I have found the job's ad that matches your expectations! Being a zookeeper in a place not so far where you live, this is completely exciting as I know that it is exactly what you are looking for. Of course and as soon as possible, I will encourage you to apply for it. If you succeed to get it, I am sure it would be absolutely amazing as we will leave your current job where you are in your office all day with no window. I know that you prefer being outside and you will love taking care of animals, this is by far the most important of the driver of your life. I am looking forward having some feedback from you about this and I am totally nervous about this. Good luck and please keep me posted.

      Hello Anna,To summarize the survey you sent me, I would say that I am in the average regarding to the kind of programs people watch regularly. But I dislike the programs as if I was in the age group 31-60 ! On the other hand, regarding to the most popular programs by age groups, I'm in the age group 46-60! Did you notice that the survey was not complete? The results concerning the amount of hours a week people watch TV are not given! Two results are predictable if you're unemployed: the moment when people watch TV, and the amount of viewing TV. Regards, John.

      I live in France. I'll give you some pointers if you visit our country. 1) If you are invited at someone's home, it's polite to take along a bunch of flowers for the woman, possibly a bottle of wine for the man. 2) If you want to go to a movie, you're expected to get in line to buy your tickets and not to play with your Iphone. 3) if you drive a car, could you please respect other drivers, and most of all respect the speed limit. The police could pick up your licence. 4) if you go to a buisness meeting, make sure you arrive few minutes early. You also are supposed to dress formally.

      Roles do males and females have changed a lot since fifty years. 50 years ago, women stayed at home, they didn't work outside. Women had to cook and take care about their family. Whereas men won money to provide the family's need. Gradually things have changed, women have begun work outside. What women can do in business ? Nothing ? This had to be difficult for women to integrate themselves into the working world. Now, this is maybe still difficult. Women are still less paid than men, there are still differences between men and women. Now days men still like win money for the family and be the &quot;boss&quot; at home. But this isn't like that, currently men take care of their children, some men are househusbands.

      Recently I have used the web site Fnac.com in order to buy tickets for a museum exhibition at the Pompidou Center in Paris. In this respect, I found easily the web site taping the key words on the web engineer google. Then, I arrived on the homepage of the site, I think that there were too much information and advertising but there was a bar on the top with all the different categories of product. Therefore, it was really quick and easy to find the selection of exhibitions even though the sheer volume of colorful information. I appreciated the page dedicated to the art performances because the site gave us a sort by success and according to the favorable opinions of previous buyers. So I could read the recommendations of people which confirmed my choice. After, I clicked on the thumbnail on the right of the picture of the exhibition I wanted to see and I found the buying page with my shopping cart. I had to select the number of tickets. Then I had to choose a mean of payment. I chose the credit card mean because I knew that the pay-pal system was really secure.%% At the end I got a summary email of my purchase and I could print directly my tickets at home so It was really convenient!

      Prepare an area of about 8m X 3m marked as the bowling alley and ten plastic bottles which you fill with a little water to make them heavier. Line the bottles up in row of 4, then 3, 2 and 1 bottle just like ten-pin bowling. Take a frisbee and shoot two times on each turn. You score one point for each knocked down pin and a &quot; strike &quot; if all the bottles are knocked down. When you make a strike, you are allowed to play two more shots and all the points are added together. The player with the most scored points is the winner.

      The other day, a drama happened in the Philippines. A hurricane destroyed everything there, and more than ten thousand people died. Even more people could lose their life in the next days, as they lack of everything: water, food, medicine and shelter. Fortunately people from all over the world are giving money to local NGOs, which are trying to rescue survivors. This disaster shows the vulnerability of coastal areas. Indeed, they are particularly exposed to hurricanes and other environmental disasters. Since a few years, several similar disasters occured in the Pacific ocean. Some scientists say they are related to global warming. For the moment, it is difficult to confirm or invalidate this theory. Nevertheless, I think that governments should tackle this issue preventively. If global warming were to be confirmed, we would have to change our ways of living quickly. What is sure is that facing environmental disasters will probably be the main issue of the twenty-first century.

      English is my second language and has played a major role in my life. Indeed, I started to learn English at the age of 9 and studied it at school to the age of 25, so English has been in a certain way the common theme to my whole school years. However, in France, the main focus is put on the French language learning, maybe because of its complexity, and we don't point out about how important the learning of English will be part of our professional and personal life in the future. Starting on the professional world on an international project, I really realized the importance of English and how French could be in late compared to the rest of the world. So when I realized that becoming bilingual will be a key point as much for my professional life than for my personal one, I decided to focus my free time activities on English learning. This could, and for sure this will, give me a lot of opportunities in the future.

      You have to have a dream... I work for a big company as an accountant. Its a first step. I need to gain experience in my job. I want to open my own accounting firm. I would have to change my lifestyle : less holiday, more overwork and fatigue and so more stress. I have thought about it. For me,  this plan is challenging. It's time for a change. This activity will be demanding but engaging and more lucrative. I know, I would have to work seventy hours or so a week.. but it's my choice.

      An area of about 8 meters x by 3 meters is marked as the bowling alley. Ten plastic bottles can be used as the bowling pins  they should be filled with a little water to make them heavier. The bottles are lined up in rows of 4, then 3, then 2, then 1 - just like ten-pin bowling.  Each player is given a frisbee and is allowed to take two shots on each turn. Players are given a total of ten turns each. One point is scored for each pin that is knocked down. If a strike is scored (all the bottles are knocked down), then the player takes two more shots and all the points are added together.%% The winner is the player with the most points. Be careful, this game should not be played on a very windy day!

      Smoking can harm the health and the government tries to limit as much as possible its consumption. Every year, new laws are voted to discourage consumers to go on. First, in a financial point of view, taxes on packs of cigarettes are often increased : the rising percentage of the prices is significant, so a lot of smokers complain that smoking is becoming a luxury. Furthermore, one tries to disgust consumer from tobacco : some advertisings make them feel guilty, and the producers are obliged to display on the packs shocking images revealing tobacco disastrous effects on the body. At last, smoking has been forbidden in more and more public places (restaurants, coffees...). Some smokers consider that such legislation represent a blow to individual rights, but the others have the right not to breathe smoke. As a matter of fact, non-smokers must be protected from passive smoking, which can have bad consequences.

      We propose to train the middle management to communication. The obvious advantage would be better flow of information between the top-level management and the employees. Another pro would be to break isolation of the middle managers. A disadvantage would be the price, but we can find good consulting companies that are not too expensive. Another con would be possible reluctance from some employees. However, the staff morale is so bad that we have no choice.

      The first demographic group is about 15- to 19- year old women, whereas the second one is about 18- to 24- year old men.As you can see, only 29 percent of women purchase at least one magazine a month. Moreover, 69 percent of women prefer magazine to blogs.Similarly, 72 percent of men prefer magazines, but much more these ones which included extensive knowledge on website. Furthermore, 47 percent purchase at lease one magazine a month.There are several competitive products, for the first group, six competitive products already exist. In comparison, there is only a long term one for men, and two recent competitive products.On the one hand, a product renown it's a good thing, but on the other hand to have several competitive products allow us to make the right choice.In 2010, the first group has a large purchasing power. However, men who make up the second group spend more money on it. In 2010, the demographic size remain steady for both group. In contrast, that will be decreasing for the second group in 2025.

It is question of a cheap game built with bottles filled with water. The children have to knock down them with a frisbee. 10 turs each. The winner is the player with the most points.

      In France, when you are invited for dinner, it's acceptable to be a little late and courteous to give a gift like flowers to your host family. It's considered good manners to shake hands when you are coming and to kiss women when you are leaving. Typically, don't put your shoes on the table, don't slurp and burp when you eat. Outside, If you are walking around don't split in the street or making out in public, it's offensive and rude. The rule is to behave formally in public. Even though people are stressed in Paris, it's better to smile and to say &quot;s'il vous plat&quot; and &quot;merci&quot; or &quot;excusez-moi&quot;. Smile and be relax, all'd be fine.

      I first met my future husband during a birthday party. A common friend invited us to her birthday in Orlans (which is a small city in France I never visited before that moment) and we were facing each other during the diner. After diner, we all went out and he was always trying to make me laught. A few weeks later, we met in a park (he told me that it was the place he liked the more in Orlans but I learned, a long time after, that it was only the second time he went there!) and we fell in love. We are now engaged.

      Product write-up: by harry The new electronic dictionary was bigger than what the others were. I tried it out myself and I thought it was great. But before you run out to buy one, think about the price. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw how much they were asking for it. I was rolling on the floor laughing so much it hurt! Well, that's not exactly true, but if I was you,I bought the biggest version. It was better value for sure. You can't deny the fact that it's the best bang for your buck. Harry

      I remember that, thirty years ago, I was visiting Spain with a friend when the car that we had hired broke down suddenly. A storm was brewing, it was eleven pm, we were far away from the nearest village, hungry and very worried when a man arrived and took us in his car. He introduced us to his family and offered us a very good meal. We spoke together for several hours and had a far better evening than we would have imagined. This experience is one of those I remember often with pleasure.

      The star wars is an old movies but has one of the most exciting plots I've ever seen. The film was directed by the famous Georges Lucas and had some of the best special effects ever seen before. Star wars has also excellent's actors, for example Harrison Ford or Liam Neeson. The story about Luke Skywalker who's joins forces with a Jedi, a cocky pilot plays by Harrisson , a wookiee and two droids to save the universe from the Empire's Evil, while also attempting to rescue Princess Leia from the evil Dark Vador. Finally, I love a lot the soundtrack of Star wars. No one had seen this type of movies before neither a soundtrack as fantastic.

In contrary, if we waste the natural resources the future couldn't be easy. Despite the actuality, I want to be optimistic about the futur. Indeed, human developpe new technologies which are able to facilitate the life or to cure some diseases. These progress are amazing but for me they have to be regulated. Finally I'm optimistic about the future if human become able to improve for the good.

Their salary was more down  of 30 to 40 percent that men for the same work. The women worked in the factories and hadn't executive position. Only, after the 1990 years, the women began to have the executive positions and take a great place in the economic of country .  But the women rise the children, often without the father, because they are more and more indpendant, it's a big problem social and family.

      I started using internet at the age of 10, so I'm accustomed to today's technology. I think that technology affects very much my life.  I have three wireless devices such as a laptop, a smartphone, a tablet PC, and these allow me to work wherever I want and I need. I use them everyday. I spend much time uploading photos that I took, chatting with my friends, and surfing online. It seems that I'm engrossed in social networking. Via internet, we can experience many things directly and indirectly at the same time. Sometimes, it's easier and less expensive way. However, this advancement of techonology is a double-edged sword. When we get totally obsessed to 'being online', we often miss the best moment of our live which is available only 'offline'. Anyway, this advancement is unstoppable. We may think how can we use technology cleverly.

      Gender differences in France are still important. For example, we have a lot of nurseries and kids can go to the school when they are two years old, so it's easier for wormen to work. And it's the case, the most of women work but the problem is that finally, they make two days in one ! Nowadays, they work and they have to care for children and housewok. In fact, it's difficult for the men to change theirs old habits and they are a minority to share actually the housework and the education of the children. For example,  for ten years,  men have the possibility to stop their work 10 days after the birth of a baby to still earn salary and despite this advantage, all the men don't profit of this opportunity. The list is still longer : women earn less, there is only few political womaen and big business women...

      So Colombia is a grateful country, you shouldn't be worry for anything. The only rule is to be yourself. Colombia is a friendly country, certainly if you are on a business trip you should be dressed like a businessman, and talk like one.  You don't give them a gift if you're invited someone's house, because the better one is that you are there having fun. There are important manners to explain on you own to be not offensive.  Don't talk about politic or money, in spite of the rising of our economy. It'll be better talk about our many different cultures and beliefs, People love it.

      Dear Polaris, I 'll give you some advices to fight your shopping addiction. Firstly, you should leave your credit card at home when you go away. In this way, you couldn't buy anything because you can't pay it. Secondly, when you want to buy something, you should do some exercices. In fact, when you practise sports, you don't think about your shopping addiction. Finally, if you need some help, you can phone me when you want. Good luck!!! Nadge

      Several things are important for me : which is the most important for me is to be happy, and so to be healthy because it is a condition to be happy. I try to think about it all the time in order to maximize my life but it isn't easy at all because I often forget it when problems happen. What is important too for me is to be outdoor and in a quiet place to not be too much bothered by some people. I would like to do a job which pleases me because I think it is very important to not be depressed by an boring, tiring or stressing job. I believe that the most important things are not the same for all people but that being happy is certainly a goal for many people.

      Hi! I saw the survey about flavours of TV programs. I see that my age group (19-30 years) like TV shows, I agree I love TV shows. Moreover this survey shows my age group doesn't like sport but I don't agree I like watch football, tennis and ski at TV. I agree with this survey because it said that women prefer soap operas. Of course, I like soap opera and reality TV.

      This is a very difficult subject for me as a really hate extreme sports! I just never tried any of them. Water is a very nice element and I like swimming, but white-water rafting or powerboat racing? What for? Regarding skydiving or rock climbing, I have a debilitating fear of heights and could not get over it. A holiday in mountain means good walks, breathing and relaxation then excellent food, no more. By the way, I do not like snow (it is cold and damp). I am very sorry for the teacher who will read my text but I have nothing to say on this topic. I am fond of yoga, Pilates and literature.

      I live in the northwest of France. In this region, there are rarely natural disasters as typhons, tornados, arthquakes...It is not a mountainous region, it doesn't snow very often and there are no volcanoes. I never knew a natural disaster. At the most, I remember 2 things: The first one is a period of drought in 1976. This year, it wasn't rained for 6 or 7 months. Everything was really dry and he water was running out. Wells were empty. My parents, who were farmers,  had difficulty in feeding theirs cows. The second is a strong storm of wind at the end of 1999. A lot of trees fell down, some on houses, some on roads. Some forests, of pine in particular, underwent enormous damages.

It will completely match your furniture. As you said, the painting represents a person with square face and I think it's a &quot;she&quot;. This person is holding both arms towards the sky. She has a long, narrow and rectangular body and she's wearing a skirt with an oval on it. I'm sure this painting will ward off the evil eye in your house and will bring you positive energies.

      Dear Sir or Madam,I am writing to enquire about the possibility of requesting a loan with the objective of buying the house I am living in.Indeed I think it would be cheaper for me to buy than to rent  in the long run. It is like a savings account and it would permit me to profit with some tax deductions. It would ensure me more security for the future, as I could eventually be free of monthly payments. Moreover, I would gain independence and would be free of change or landscaping.Please find enclosed a financial projection. Actually I have a monthly total income of $2000. I put every month $800 in my rent and $480 in the savings account, which amounts to a total of $1280. That confirms I would be able to afford loan payments.Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need more information.Yours sincerely,Muriel FRIDMANN

      I only really understand the importance of being able to speak fluently English at adulthood. Like the other children of my age in my country, I start learning English at 10, at the equivalent of British school Year Seven. To my opinion, It's yet too late to start learning a second language, and with just some hours of English lessons a week, pupils mostly end college with only a basic level. That what I realized when I start working. Despite my goods grades at school, It was very difficult for me to do what I was asked for - answer to the phone or attend international meetings. It also took me all this time to discover that being proficient in English could give access to a global community useful not only for work but in leisure too. And I needed to work on it. From some years, I have been learning English again. I try to combine useful and enjoyable, by watching English dramas or reading books unknowns in my country. I also read the news from foreign press, witch help me widening my point of view. I know that, thanks to all this, my level is far better than it was when I left college.%% I can see it every time I go abroad or during meetings in English. But every time, I also realize I still have a lot of work to do before being fluent in English and no more ask to my interlocutor : &quot;Sorry, what did you said?&quot;.

      Home Grandma remedies !!! Here are some of them : If you suffer with congestion, make a poultice of mustard powder mixed with water, and then place it on your chest, it's just miraculous! Are you suffering from high ferver ? Wear socks, soaked in vinegar and thyme, but be careful with the smell! Big nose mustn't try it, even if it's worth it. Eventually, if you have any kind of nausea, like travel sickness or morning sickness, just chew Ginger and Raspberry leaf, or put them in a tea. That's just a sample of good natural remedies I can provide! Contact me.

      Dear Grandma, Thank you to give me your home remedies. I think that ginger and raspberry leaf to help any kind of nausea, like travel sickness, is a very good medicine for my business. Indeed, a lot of children are sick during travel (car, plane, train). That is why, their mothers will be interesting because natural medicines are better for children. Your spoonful of honey and ginger for a sore throat and your poultice of mustard powder for congestion are some good ideas too. Indeed, in winter, a lot of people often have a sore throat. Yours lovingly, Mary

      My first professional experience was in the office of an international tax lawyer. I was in charge of the edition of a bimonthly brochure. Prior to that, I had graduated from college in law. But we decided with my husband to move to another area, in a small town we loved and there, no possibility to find anything in my line of work. I did different jobs and eventually found a good position in a big real estate agency. My post was the management of the seasonal rentals: Big properties with staff for rich clients. No bubble burst and interesting but so stressing and demanding. After 13 years, I went back to my first and real attraction, which is the world of the edition. I created my own office of proofreading (less money but so motivating).

Before I outline the sections of my presentation, here's an interesant fact. Did you know the new law on health and safety ? A new law demands to eliminate lead and cadmium in chimical preparations. So with that in mind, my presentation will be split into three parts. Firstly, I'm going to talk about the compositions of our glass enamels. Then, I'm going to talk about why we need to change these compositions and how to implement lead free and cadmium free glass enamels. Finally, I'm going to conclude about the attempted results of this new implementation.

      Tv may be the most interesting thing and at the same time the worse. It depends on who you are, the channel you choose and the time you spend watching it. Documentaries, weather, news are good for almost everybody. Soap opera may be good for old people who are retired, or have nothing else to do, sitcom or play may interest students or working people after a long stressfull day. In any case, the most important is to choose a program or a channel, not just to be a couch potatoe, and to limit the number of hours you spend watching tv a day.
"

      I am amazed at how silly TV is. I feel strongly that TV is too stupid in my country. For example, there are more than 2 reality shows per night. How is possible ? Educational series only exist on cable channels. We have to pay to watch an educational channel. Children are sometimes home by themselves, so they can watch silly shows. It is not good for them. I feel strongly that we should stop watching these silly programs and demand more educational ones.

      My parents live in Paris and I have brothers and sisters. Some of them are living near Paris, others are living abroad. I dont see them very often and not as often we would like. But at least once a year, we have a family gathering. Usually we all meet for Christmas in Paris. I am not that keen on family meals, hours at table with all my brothers, sisters, nephews and nieces. We are about twelve or more at table. Anyway, we came in Paris with my wife and kids. We prepared the table in a traditional way, with a beautiful table cloth and napkins. My mother set the silverware, glasses for wine, for water and for Champagne. To understand what was arriving later, you have to consider that all these things came from my fathers family. My brothers and sisters like to take care about that. At time, everyone started to eat with good manners. The napkins on the lap, using the right cutlery. I decided to help my mother and to move toward the kitchen with a tray full of champagnes glasses. And unfortunately, the tray drop on the floor, breaking the glasses. What a mess! My father was petrified, my mother was really offended and all my family somewhat annoyed.%% Oh, my gosh! I made the most terrible blunder. I was so embarrassed. We were feeling very awkward after that. I was only trying to help. It was by far the worst thing that it could be happen. I apologize for my clumsiness, I was so sorry about that. My parents accepted mi apologizes, saying that we all make mistakes but my brothers and sisters didnt appreciate the lost of those glasses. To conclude, I can say as a French idiom that only those who do nothing dont make mistakes.

      It was by a dark night, as dark as the grave he now is, that Robert Cox, the eighty years old man who founded the powerful Cox Oil company , was found dead in his own house. His mansion, to be more precise. He got stabbed right in the heart with his own jewel-encrusted dagger. At first, everyone thought he was killed by his older son, Patrick. They had a fight a few day ago about the company because Robert was still the chief executive officer and, according to Patrick, he was taking really bad decisions. So, Patrick was suspected and has he had no alibi this evening, he went to a trial for this crime. But wait, you haven't heard the end. After a few days, a detective found that Robert Cox became bankrupt and that the company was going into liquidation. And Robert was the only one to know about that. Finally, Patrick was judged innoncent. But he inherited a lot of debts!

The topic was &quot; a healthy diet and regular exercise, the secrets of longevity ? &quot;. We made a slideshow for all that is said is illustrated. I summarized the part about the food : a vital need. I try to articulate my thoughts on the most important things. I gave examples with statistics obtained by pie charts and bar graphs. The jury also commended on these good points : we watched very little our sheet of paper and were really into the topic that the jury found it very interesting. Just a slight regret, we talked a little longer than expected.

This tall blond women became one of my best friends, and she still is. Our children have been very good friends, and our husbands too.

      I'm not a crazy fashion but I like to see the difference style. I wear classic clothes because I do not like the colors too flashy and I hate to be noticed. I love dress and pants, dress because it's so pratique and chic and pants because it's beautiful, hot (for winter) and also chic. My clothes favorite is, without hesitation, the t-shirt because I love motifs, colors and style. The t-shirt is a very good invention. It's pratique, fashion, all styles ! It's WAHOU !!!

      I went to London with my girlfriend in November. We visited a lot of places. We lived an awesome experience at Kensington Palace. When we entered the palace, a man gave us a pull-out. Then, we understood that there were enigmas to solve about princesses who had lived here. The rooms were decorated like in a gothic fairy tale. We met the &quot;Illuminators&quot;, people dressed with an overcoat and a lamp on their brow. They told us many stories. One of them asked us to lay down to describe a ceiling. It was a funny way to visit a palace.

      In France, we have a very  strict laws about driving and alcohol. I think that if the laws are so strict it's because of accidents caused by drinking and driving, in the past. The first time the police catch you drinking and driving, you have to pay a fine and sometimes, lose your license. You can also go to jail. If we are without a license can be debilitating for some people. Indeed, some people use their car for their work. It is necessary that the sanction be strict in order to frighten people and reduce the risk of accidents.

      I live near Paris, the nicest and the most beautiful town over the world. Beautiful because of the size of buildings and avenues. Tipically, buildings are six or seven-story high and were built in the mid 19th century. We have a curious tower designed by Mister Gustave Eiffel and built from steel in 1887.That became the most important symbol of Paris in the world. This old-fashioned Eiffel Tower is about 320 meters high with antennas. Nobody's living in. We just find a famous restaurant on the top and a lovely place to admire the beautiful townscape and to dream about a fabulous date with a really nice young woman. Moreover, we can see the Tour Montparnasse built from steel and glass. Its a dark glass building for business and housing situated near the main rail station inside of Paris. The tallest buildings are built in the area called La Defense outside of Paris. Most of them are business buildings for all kind of companies. Many modern towers were designed over there for a huge amount of business workers. This area makes you feel like youve been kidnapped by a strange community of people, over worked and over stressed, moving around a large esplanade like an antique meeting.%%

      The last week I have attended a presentation. The presenter was good. He is a good speaker and his voice was really strong. He was emphasizing all the key point. I had use usefull charts to explain the increasing of the sales.His introduction was simply interesting and the audience was directly focus on the topic. But if had used more pie charts, the explanations would have been more clear for all the staff. And If he had more smile, we would have been less serious and more opened. His conclusion was boring. I think If he had talked about a big point, his conclusion would have been more compelling. In conclusion it was a presentation with more good points than bad points.

      We went on the east coast of the United States last summer. One sunny day we decided to go to the fun fear in Coney Island. It was a wonderful place, as we had imagining it after seeing many movies taking place in that area. My husband and my son decided to go in a attraction nammed the &quot;wild river&quot;. Just after the river fall, their &quot;water&quot; train derailed and the attraction was closed for maintenance. They had to finish the river with their feet in the water. We laughed a lot.

We start at 8:30 am and finish at 18:00 pm. There are 100 people in office, give or take. Most people work about 40 hours a week. We feel very good with our healthy work-life balance.

      During this meeting, the main item was our strategy in order to win our legal cases. My boss is used to work with people coming from the USA, so he is used to be an advisor as well as a lawyer. We also talked about the judicial schedule and how concerned some of the lawyers working with us should be. It lasts more than hour and the other executive seemed to have to deal with much more cases than my boss did! Because nobody got fired, we didn't talk about it. However, no one was hired either.

      I recently ate at an italian restaurant called 'la Botega'. It's a famous restaurant in the old-Lille (France), it was for my birthday so we had maked reservations a week ago. The place was very roomy and calm. The waiter was very friendly and asked if he could get us something. We ordered some water and wine and have started looking at the menu. I took a vegetarian pizza, whit some asparus, mushrooms, cheese and tomatoes and a tiramisu as a dessert. All was very tasty and the price wasn't that high! I recommend the restaurant to anybody who likes italian food!

      we can find difference between the two website presented: The first one seems to be more nice than the second. In the first website presented, we can see several advantages such as good customer service, diverse delivery option, an excellent product range and quality, a numerous functionality while in the second site there are less advantage. In summary, we can't find positive things in the second website. All thing should be change and improved such as the usability, the quality and product range are low, the payment and delivery options aren't very diverse, the customer service are not good too, we can't find any extra functionality as in the first one, technical service are bad in their domain.

      Hello Im writing to the website in order to be able to throw a brick to Johnnie Oliveira. Celebrities should stick to doing what they know bestbeing famous and not investigate honorific causes. Johnnie Oliveira is one of the star media-hogging who are always on talk show, donor dinner etc. I think that the stars dont need to jump on the voguish bandwagon of honor cause.Many of them take this opportunity to continue earning big bucks. Its really important to try fighting hunger disaster around the world. And I have a great admiration for stars that are using without no return their celebrity to help non-governmental organizations involved in those fights. Having 10% of your fortune as donations is definitely important but it must be disinterested. Some stars use this way to escape or to optimize their taxes. I sometimes try to understand those stars that refuse to pay a lot of money for the others but my question is: this behavior is it social or fraternal with people who share the same country? And what about ethics on sharing, humanity, helping poor people etc. As a star your celebrity can deserve you surely. You need to have nerves of steel at all moments. I understand they push themselves to their limit all time but earning less money this year compared to the past one is not a train smash. I have had enough of this boastful behavior of certain stars. They are faced with making a complex decision how to earn more money and how to appear honorable over the people. I would like now to moderate my words. They are few stars with innate benevolence, who adopt orphans fro; poor country and give them an unexpected life. The couple of Brad & Angelina is a great example. I have a big respect for them as a parent of two kids and I continue asking myself how they are doing with their 7 children.
