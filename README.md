# Data-Challenge---CEFR-prediction

## Data Challenge - Prediction of the CEFR Level of English Texts

### Points to be addressed by team members:

| Date       | Member  | Tasks                                                                  |
|------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 20 February| Yasser  | - Push the code for RobertA-base <br> - Test for Mistral <br> - Test for Gpt2 |
| 20 February| Yaniv   | - Push codes: preprocessing <br> - TF_idf                             |
| 20 February| Gabriel | - Exploratory data analysis for further preprocessing                  |

### Additional Ideas:

- **Yasser**: Instead of fine-tuning BERT, use it as an embedding generator, and train using nonlinear ML models.
- **Gabriel**: Re-work on calibration of data: analyze mails in data for further insights.
